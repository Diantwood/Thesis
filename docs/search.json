    "text": "Preface\n\n“Explorers are we, intrepid and bold, out in the wild, amongst wonders untold. Equipped with our wits, a map, and a snack; we’re searching for fun and we’re on the right track!” - Calvin and Hobbes\n\nWhen I first started my honours thesis, I was excited at for what lied ahead. I was oozing confidence, naively arrogant, that I was going to achieve so much. While it isn’t a thesis worthy of the lofty expectations, it is completed. And more importantly I learned a lot.\nMaybe the best way to get you excited about my thesis, is to tell you why I was so excited about it when I first started. I’m a technology-inclined guy. So, I was aware of OLEDs, organic light emitting diodes, before I was introduced to them in the physics context. OLEDs were, and still are, everywhere on the forefront of display technology. You can find them as the screen for every modern phone, or even on the new Nintendo OLED Switch (valued at roughly $100 more). Or if you go to the any TV distributor, the OLEDs are clearly the priciest and highest quality looking TVs. If you wanted a good screen, the device should be using OLEDs – that much I knew.\nWhat I didn’t know would come next. It never clicked for awhile that OLEDs were just Organic LEDs. Organic in the sense they are made of carbon-based molecules. We’ll touch on later why that is important. But I’ll spoil the main interesting part of that now. If it is organic, it is really easy to alter the structure of the molecule to fine-tune the properties of the OLED. You can likely make the link yourself that this opens the possibility of doing so much, not only in terms of efficiency in manufacturing, but also making new things altogether. This is where the idea for organic lasers came about.\nOrganic lasers, like regular lasers, but as before made from carbon-based molecules. If you’re a tech person, you might already know that there aren’t any organic lasers on the Coles shelves yet. In fact, no one has been able to make organic lasers (at the time of writing). Again, it’d be rude to giveaway the entire reason why now, but organic materials have a handicap that makes it difficult to get the energy output a laser requires.\nThis is where my thesis comes into it. I set out to, while not exactly make a laser, but test a very promising organic material and see whether it meets the lasing requirements. The material, 2,6-diphenylanthracene (2,6-DPA), is promising because it may exhibit a neat function that may overcome the handicap that I talked about earlier.\nThat is about it for an introduction, without getting into the nitty gritty. But I will include my abstract below with all the jargon in it for those who want a summary of the above in fewer words.\n\n\nAbstract\n\nLasers have left an indelible mark on science and technology, from applications ranging from medicine to telecommunications to spectroscopy – we are even starting to see laser televisions. To this day, no one has realised organic laser diodes despite the rapid and burgeoning success of organic semiconductors. This failure is because an organic laser diode needs to be injected with high current densities to achieve lasing, a threshold that seems out of reach because of the inherent losses caused by the non-emissive triplet excited states. Managing these excited states, or better yet turning them into emissive singlet states, lies at the focus of realising organic lasers. This thesis will demonstrate the exciting potential of using triplet-triplet upconversion – a process that annihilates two triplets to form the emissive singlets – to help reduce the current density threshold. I argue for the lasing potential of the highly emissive lasing material 3-(2-Benzothiazolyl)-N,N-diethylumbelliferylamine (Coumarin6) when doped into 2,6-diphenylanthracene (2,6-DPA) that herein is confirmed to exhibit triplet-triplet upconversion."

    "section": "1.1 Organic semiconductors",
    "text": "1.1 Organic semiconductors\nThe best way to introduce organic semiconductor laser diodes is to begin with how the phrase starts: organic semiconductor. First the basics of organic semiconductors (OSCs) will be introduced, followed by the underlying photophysics of organic semiconductors. Then the optical and electrical properties of OSCs will be elucidated, subsequently followed by the energy transfer mechanisms. Next is where triplet-triplet annihilation will be introduced. Naturally, the various losses in organic semiconductors will be explored next. To tie it into how to test organic semiconductors, organic light emitting diodes will set the stage for the rest of the thesis. Finally, organic laser diodes and the physics of lasers will be included to put this all into context of lasers.\n\n1.1.1 General properties of organic semiconductors\nOrganic compounds contain a covalently bound carbon atom, whose binding configurations enable more than 19 million different possible organic compounds each with various properties (Gärtner 2009). It is easy to alter the organic compound’s molecular structure, which is extremely fortunate for optoelectronic applications since their optical and electrical properties depend on their structure. In 1976, the discovery of conducting polymers began the journey of new generation polymers that had electrical and optical properties of metals or semiconductors, while retaining the benefits of easily processed polymers (Heeger 2001).\nCarbon atoms can bond to each other in single, double, and triple bonds. Organic compounds that have exclusively single bonds (four bonds per carbon atom) are unable to conduct electricity due to the binding energy of a single bond being in the ground state. Hence these molecules (e.g. polystyrene) cannot be used for electronics apart from cladding of electric cables.\nMolecules that have alternating single and double bonds are called conjugated molecules. In a conjugated molecule, the carbon atoms form three strongly bound \\(\\sigma\\)-bonds and one weakly bound \\(\\pi\\)-bond. The skeletal structure of the polymer is formed by the \\(\\sigma\\)-bonds, with the delocalized \\(\\pi\\)-electrons (comprising the \\(\\pi\\)-bonds) able to travel along the polymer chain. The \\(\\pi\\)-electron (binding energy of \\(1 eV\\)) upon excitation can go to the anti-binding \\(\\pi^*\\)-state, where the distance between comprises the commonly known band gap. Typically, for these conjugated molecules, the band gap is around \\(2.5 eV\\). These conjugated molecules exhibit semiconducting properties because of their ability to transport charges along the polymer chain.\nThere are a few classes of organic semiconductors. One class is \\(\\pi\\)-conjugated polymers that can be processed from solution by spin-coating. While this technique is cheap and feasible over large areas, the ability to create multilayer devices is inhibited by the failure to dissolve all layers. Light emission from electrical injection, or electroluminescence, was first observed in 1990 using conjugated molecules (Burroughes et al. 1990). Similarly, optically pumped lasers were shown in 1996 (Hide et al. 1996; Tessler, Denton, and Friend 1996).\nAnother class is small molecules that have low-molecular weight. These molecules also have delocalized \\(\\pi\\)-electrons. This class can be processed by thermal evaporation under high vacuum. While this technique requires specialised equipment, the technique benefits from deposition of multilayer devices of arbitrary combinations. Evaporating multiple materials simultaneously means the layers can be doped. Doping gives access to altering the band gap characteristics of the main (host) material, which will change the conductivity, emission, and absorption properties of the material (Duarte 2018). Tang et al. (Tang, VanSlyke, and Chen 1989) and Adachi et al. (Adachi, Tsutsui, and Saito 1990) demonstrated how host-dopant systems in OLEDs led to greater control of emission colour and electroluminescence efficiency (through the guest) and control over the charge transport and electron-hole pair formation and transfer (through the host). Small molecule-semiconductors first saw optically pumped laser operation in 1997 (Tang and VanSlyke 1987). The other organic semiconductor classes that have seen successful device fabrication include single crystals (anthracene) (Wang et al. 2007), conjugated dendrimers (Lawrence et al. 2004), and spiro-compounds (Spehr et al. 2005). Some common organic molecules, as well as the ones present in this thesis, have their organic structure shown in Figure 1.2.\nTo provide a quick recap, organic conjugated molecules can be excited electrically and optically by photons in the visible range because of the low-binding energy of the delocalized \\(\\pi\\)-electrons along the polymer chain. These conjugated molecules thus offer semiconducting properties. The question to propel us forward is: how can these conjugated molecules emit all of the visible wavelengths of light? Hence to tackle this, next the optical properties of the conjugated molecules will be discussed."

    "text": "1.2 Optical properties of organic semiconductors\nIn the organic semiconducting picture, the electrons of the \\(\\sigma\\)-bond can be ignored because they are tightly bound as opposed to the delocalized \\(\\pi\\)-electron that can be excited between the \\(\\pi-\\pi^*\\) states. The \\(\\pi\\)-state can be thought of as the ground state, or the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Its counterpart is the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) or \\(\\pi^*\\)-state. It is worth noting that the band gap is the difference between the electron affinity (EA) of the layer and the ionization potential (IP), and it is often smaller than the difference between LUMO and HOMO (see Figure 1.1) (Tang and VanSlyke 1987). The molecules in Figure Figure 1.2 have their HOMO/LUMO as well as other properties are shown in Table 1.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: HOMO-LUMO energy diagram for organic semiconductors showing the electron affinity (EA), ionization potential (IP), and the bad gap in relation to the energy needed to reach vacuum\n\n\n\n\nOLED host, dopant, and charge generation molecules\n\n\nOrganic molecule\nFormula and molecular weight (amu)\nHOMO [LUMO]\nApplication\nRef.\n\n\n\n\nAlq3\n\\(C_{27}H_{18}AlN_3O_3\\ 459.43\\)\n\\(-5.7\\ [-2.9]\\)\nElectron transport and host\n(Djurovich et al. 2009; Tao, Yang, and Qin 2011)\n\n\nTPBI\n\\(C_{45}H_{30}N_6 \\ 654.76\\)\n\\(-6.2 \\ [-2.7]\\)\nElectron transport and exciton blocking\n(Tao, Yang, and Qin 2011)\n\n\nNPB\n\\(C_{44}H_{32}N_2 \\ 588.74\\)\n\\(-5.4 \\ [-2.3]\\)\nHole transport\n(Tao, Yang, and Qin 2011; J.

This delocalized charge pair is called an exciton. Excitons are stable at room temperature because of their large binding energy (\\(1 eV\\)) compared to its thermal activation energy (\\(k_BT=25 meV\\)) (Gärtner 2009). It is then easier to interpret the optical (and electrical) properties in this exciton picture. Excitons have many excitonic states, but the lowest is the ground state \\(S_0\\). Each excitonic state has many sub-states that offshoot energetically due to vibrational fluctuations (see Figure 1.3). The bandgap separates the ground state \\(S_0\\) and the first excited state \\(S_1\\). A photon can excite the exciton from the ground state to a higher vibronic state of a singlet state, and then subsequently relax to the lowest vibronic state in 1 ps timescale. Then the lowest vibronic state of the \\(S_1\\) can decay either radiatively (emitting light) or nonradiatively to the groundstate with a lifetime of 1 ns. Because the absorption normally transitions to a higher vibronic state and then relax to a lower vibronic state, the emission spectra tends to be redshifted (lower energy) compared to the absorption spectra. This energy difference between the spectra is referred to as Stokes shift (Forget and Chénais 2013; Gärtner 2009). Lasers benefit from Stokes shift because it helps reduce self absorption losses.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Basic transitions within an organic molecule between the ground state \\(S_0\\) and the excited singlet \\(S_1\\), \\(S_2\\),… \\(S_n\\) and triplet states \\(T_1\\), \\(T_2\\),… \\(T_n\\), represented in a Jablonski diagram\n\n\nExcitons, after they absorb a photon, transition to the singlet state. Singlet states can undergo fluorescent decay (emission of light) or undergo intersystem crossing (ISC) into the triplet state. In typical fluorescent devices, the lifetime of fluorescent decay is much shorter than ISC. ISC becomes enhanced in phosphorescent materials because of their strong spin-orbit coupling. The triplet state \\(T_1\\) has long lifetimes of \\(\\mu s\\)-\\(ms\\), which have subsequent pathways that include phosphorescent decay or reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). These pathways are shown in Figure 1.3. Triplet deactivation are dominated by nonradiative decay at room temperature, hence why triplets are usually called non-emissive states. Phosphorescent decay can be increased by using heavy metal atoms with strong spin-orbit coupling.\nOpposed to a radiative decay (fluorescence) with a decay rate \\(k_r\\), a molecule can decay nonradiatively to the groundstate by internal conversion (IC). It has a decay rate \\(k_{nr}=\\tau_{nr}^{-1}\\). To avoid nonradiative decay (NRD), a rigid and planar molecular structure can be introduced to not have the vibrational coupling of \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_0\\) states, i.e. the \\(S_1\\) will not vibrationally transfer its energy to \\(S_0\\). Small band gap (long-wavelengths) molecules will suffer from vibrational coupling – the effect is labeled the energy gap law."

    "section": "1.3 Electrical properties of organic semiconductors",
    "text": "1.3 Electrical properties of organic semiconductors\nThis section will be more detailed than the optical Section 1.2 because this report mainly focuses on electrically pumped laser diodes and OLEDs. First the basics will be discussed, followed by charge carriers and their process from injection to transportation.\n\n1.3.0.1 Charge carriers\nElectrons and holes within an organic semiconductor interact stronger with the fixed atoms than in inorganic materials (Gärtner 2009). This stronger interaction causes a new consideration for holes and electrons – a quasiparticle called a polaron (Forget and Chénais 2013). The lower polaronic state is occupied by a single charge, while the upper polaronic state is occupied with two charges. The LUMO level fills the lower polaronic state with positive polarons (holes) and the HOMO level fills the higher polaronic state with negative polarons (electrons). The polaronic stated cause additional absorption bands, resulting in a new type of loss: polaron induced absorption.\n\n\n1.3.0.2 Charge Transport\nCharge carriers in conjugated polymers are localized to a portion of the polymer chain, usually called the active unit or chromophore, because of the lack of long-range translational symmetry (L. Li and Kosina 2010; Gärtner 2009). Thus the only way for charges to transfer between neighbouring molecules is via phonon assisted tunnelling, or a stochastic hopping process. The mobility of this hopping in organic semiconductors is between \\(10^{-8} cm/Vs\\) to \\(10^{-3} cm^2/Vs\\). Because hopping is highly inefficient, it explains the very low carrier mobilities in organic semiconductors, contrasted to their inorganic counterparts (Forget and Chénais 2013). The charge transport of an organic material is given by its electric conductivity \\(\\sigma\\) that depends on the density of the charge carriers \\(n\\), and the charger carrier mobility \\(\\mu\\), given by \\[\\sigma = \\mu n q\\]where \\(q\\) is the elementary electron charge (Forget and Chénais 2013). We can see from this relation that in order to achieve high electrical conductivity, and thus a high charge transport, the charge carrier mobility must be high. Further information on charge transport in organic semiconductors can be found in Refs. (L. Li and Kosina 2010; Shirota and Kageyama 2007; Coropceanu et al. 2007).\n\n\n1.3.0.3 Electron-hole recombination\nSimilar to optical properties, because the exciton is stable at room tempetature, it is best to consider the the charge carrier pair in the exciton picture. In organic semiconductors, recombining electrons and holes generate excitons. Light emission is thus the radiative decay of these excitons. The recombination is governed by Langevin theory (Pope and Swenberg 1982), such that we get the exciton formation formula \\[e + h \\rightarrow\n\\begin{cases}\n    1/4,& S_n^*\\rightarrow S_1\\\\\n    3/4,& T_n^*\\rightarrow T_1\n\\end{cases}\\] where \\(S_n\\) and \\(T_n\\) are the higher-lying singlet and triplet states respectively (Gärtner 2009). Their lifetime is about 1 ps because of their ultra fast relaxation to the lowest excited state \\(S_1\\) or \\(T_1\\). Spin statistics (Adachi and Sandanayaka 2020) govern the 3:1 generation ratio of triplets to singlet excitons, which has been experimentally determined (Lupton et al. 2005). It is also important to note that these probabilities occur only when the singlet–triplet gap is much less than \\(k_BT\\). Most practical molecules are within this bound at room temperature; however, if the singlet–triplet gap is much larger than \\(k_BT\\), triplets form with nearly \\(100\\%\\) probability (Jacko, McKenzie, and Powell 2010). In other words, excitons decay to the ground state via the lowest triplet state if the singlet–triplet energy gap is larger than \\(k_BT\\).\nThe recombination of holes and electrons have a rate that is given by \\[\\gamma = \\frac{e(\\mu_e+\\mu_h)n_e(x,t)n_h(x,t)}{\\epsilon_r\\epsilon_0}\\] where recombination \\(\\gamma\\) is a function of the charge carrier mobilities \\(\\mu_e\\) and \\(\\mu_h\\), and the electron density \\(n_e(x,t)\\) and hole density \\(n_h(x,t)\\). From this, high exciton generation needs high mobility materials as well as higher particle densities. Hole mobility is typically one order of magnitude larger than the electron mobility – such a difference means the recombination \\(\\gamma\\) mainly depends on the higher mobility.\n\n\n1.3.0.4 Charge carrier injection\nTo pass a current (charges) through an organic semiconductor it has to be sandwiched between an anode and cathode. The entire structure is called an organic semiconductor light emitting diode (OLED). Once a voltage is applied across the electrodes, the electrons and holes diffuse through the layers. While OLEDs usually have a current density of a few \\(mA/cm^2\\), laser diodes require much higher current densities. The electrons are injected into the LUMO and the holes into the HOMO to form an exciton. OLEDs will be discussed further in Section 1.5.\n\n\n1.3.1 Energy Transfer\nExcitons play a pivotal role into how the organic molecule emits light but their dynamics are not as simple as stationary particles. They can have their energy transferred across several nanometers, which enables movement between identical molecules and between a host/guest system. These energy transfers can enable unique energy pathways to increase the total light emission. The two main transfers in organic semiconductors will be discussed next.\n\n1.3.1.1 Förster resonance energy transfer\nFörster (sometimes called fluorescent) resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a resonant energy transfer process between two singlet exciton states of two molecules. It is a resonant process because the excited donor molecule (\\(D^*\\)) decays without emission of a photon, and then transfers the energy to an accepting molecule (A) (see Figure 1.4). FRET is goverend by Fermi’s golden rule for transfer between states, which means they have a transfer rate \\(\\Gamma_{DA}\\) from a donor (D) to acceptor (A) is \\[\\Gamma_{DA} = 4\\pi^2|V_{DA}|^2]\\delta(E_A-E_M)\\] where \\(V_{DA}\\) is the matrix element for interaction of the donor and acceptor, who have energies \\(E_D\\) and \\(E_A\\) respectively (Gärtner 2009). The \\(\\delta\\)-function describes the need for the energies to match, or at least have spectral overlap of the absorption and emission spectrum. Even though the energy transfer occurs without the emission of a photon, we tend to say that typically the spectrum of the donor \\(g_A(E)\\) overlaps with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor \\(g_D(E)\\). The long-range dipole-dopole interactions between D and A cause the pairing of spectrum overlap. This coupling influences the rate of energy transfer, as well as the quantum yield of the donor, the relative orientation of D and A transition dipoles, and the distance between the molecules. Integrating over the spectral overlap and evaluating the interaction matrix elements provides the Förster formula which provides the total transfer rate \\(k_{DA}\\) \\[k_{DA} = 8.8\\times10^{17} \\frac{\\kappa^2}{n^4\\tau_Dr^6}\\int g_A(E)g_D(E)dE\\] which then can be written as \\[k_{DA}(r) = \\frac{1}{\\tau_D}\\left(\\frac{R_0}{r}\\right)^6\\] where \\(\\tau_D\\) is the decay time of the donor in the absence of the acceptor, \\(\\kappa\\) is the relative orientation of the dipoles, \\(R_0\\) is the Förster distance (typically a few nanometers (Lakowicz 2006)), and \\(r\\) is the D-to-A distance. Clearly, FRET is an extremely distance dependent process (\\(k_{FRET}\\propto r^{-6}\\)). FRET usually occurs at distances of 20 to 90 Å, typical distances of proteins or membrane thickness (Lakowicz 2006). The transitions must be allowed, so that is why this process only works for singlet excitons.\nFRET is mainly seen in a host/guest system, where in order to get singlets from the host to guest, we utilise FRET to transfer singlets on the host to the guest. FRET governs some of the bimolecular annihilation processes that are important in organic semiconductors. The key takeaway from this information is that this process is distance dependent, with a \\(50\\%\\) efficiency at \\(r=R_0\\) calculated from the efficiency \\(\\rho\\) of the energy transfer (Forget and Chénais 2013) \\[\\rho = \\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{r}{R_0}\\right)^6}\\]\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Förster resonance energy transfer is a dipole-dipole interaction, where in the absence of a photon, the Donor D releases energy that is reabsorbed by the acceptor A. The must be overlap between emission spectrum and absorption spectrum for the transfer to happen. Dexter energy transfer has simultaneous exchange of electrons and holes, such that an exciton is transferred between D and A. Singlets are displayed here, but Dexter energy transfer does work for triplets too.\n\n\n\n\n1.3.1.2 Dexter energy transfer\nDET is one of the mechanisms of short-range quenching, and like the name suggest the molecules need to be close. So close in fact that the D molecule and quencher Q must have their electronic clouds overlap. DET describes an exchange of electrons from the LUMO of the donor to the LUMO of the acceptor. Similarly the hole is transferred the other way in the HOMO. Such that the net transfer in a host/guest system is an exciton moving between the D and A (Dexter 1953). The difference between DET and Fret can be found in in Figure 1.4. The rate of DET \\(k_{DET}\\) is \\[k_{DET} = \\hbar P^2Je^\\frac{-2r}{L}\\] where r is distance between D and A, \\(J\\) is the spectral overlap, and the other variables, P and L, are constants that are hard to quantify (Dexter 1953). DET occurs only across distances between \\(0.5\\)-\\(2\\) nm, compared to the \\(2\\)-\\(10\\) nm of FRET."

    "text": "1.4 Losses in organic semiconductors\nThe current densities needed to achieve organic laser diodes are estimated to be at least \\(1 kA/cm^2\\) (Adachi and Sandanayaka 2020). In organic semiconductors, to obtain this threshold means that the particle densities must be around \\(10^{19}/cm^3\\) and electric fields of up to \\(10^7 V/cm\\) are needed – this is considering the low mobilities of organic semiconductors \\(10^{-8}-10^{-3}cm^2/Vs\\) (Gärtner 2009). Thus the populations of excitons will need to be extremely high – a perfect environment for increased bimolecular annihilation processes. Here, a description of these process will be described.\nBimolecular annihilation processes occur between particles within the organic semiconductor, such as charge carriers and excitons. Most of these processes quench the emissive singlet excitons (see Figure 1.5). Hence, these processes are important to realising efficient light emission. The diagram indicates the particle species by the circles, and which population they are quenching by the direction of the arrows. Table 1.2 shows the processes in terms of donor (D) and acceptor (A).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: The bimolecular annihilation process are displayed in relation to singlets S1, triplets T1, and polarons e and h.

The rate of SSA \\(k_{SSA}\\) in terms of the \\(S_1\\) population is given by \\[\\frac{dS_1}{dt} = -(2-\\zeta)k_{SSA}S_1^2\\] where \\(\\zeta\\) factor is because not all excited states \\(S_n\\) are returned to the \\(S_1\\) state. The spin conservation is governed by spin statistics (Lupton et al. 2005), usually \\(\\zeta=0.25\\) (Thompson et al. 2014). \\(k_{ss}\\) is usually on the order of \\(10^{-9} cm^3/s\\). To measure this rate constant \\(k_{SSA}\\) transient photoluminescence measurements can be done (Sokolik et al. 1996), which involves a pulse measurement to a width less than the lifetime of radiative singlet decay. Naturally, when the population of singlets are low, the rate of SSA becomes negligible.\n\n\n1.4.0.2 Exciton-polaron annihilation\nBoth singlet-polaron annihilation (SPA) and triplet-polaron annihilation occur under electrical injection because of the high lifetimes of polarons. The basic concept is the excitons transfer their energy by deactivation to the polaron via the process \\[S_1 / T_1 + (e,h) \\rightarrow S_0 + (e,h)\\] where the rate of \\(k_{SPA}\\) can be different for hole or electron quenching. At low current densities, SPA is negligible, but starts becoming a serious issue the more current injected.\n\n\n1.4.0.3 Singlet-Triplet Annihilation\nIf the \\(S_1\\) and the \\(T_1\\) state share overlap, the singlet and triplets can interact causing an excitation to a higher triplet state \\(T_n\\) and a nonradiative decay to the ground state. The process is \\[S_1 + T_1 \\rightarrow S_0 + T_n\\] For non-TADF materials, where reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) is unlikely, the excited state \\(T_n\\) will relax back to the long-lived \\(T_1\\) and then subsequently non-radiatively decay back the ground state. The rate equation for STA is \\[\\frac{dS_1}{dt} = -k_{STA}S_1T_1\\] where \\(k_{STA}\\) is usually on the order of \\(10^{-9} cm^3/s\\). This process is a FRET type transfer, and especially dominate in conjugated polymers(List et al. 2002) because the triplets accumulate in the device due to their long lifetimes.\n\n\n1.4.0.4 Intersystem Crossing (ISC)\nFor every excited singlet state, a triplet state lies lower in energy by an amount \\(\\Delta E_{ST}\\) that is often referred to as the singlet-triplet splitting. While not pertinent to understand why this is the case, the extremely simplified explanation is that Pauli exclusion principle forces the spatial factor of the singlet wave function to be symmetric and anti-symmetric for the triplet wave function. This symmetry/antisymmetry causes the mean potential energy of the electrons to be higher for singlets than triplets with the same quantum numbers n and m. To read more in detail see Ref. (Stuke 1992). This relationships means we get overlap with the wave functions that scales exponentially with \\(\\Delta E_{ST}\\). Thus a nearly spontaneous transfer from the \\(S_1\\) population to the lower \\(T_1\\) state becomes possible, which is called intersystem crossing (ISC). The pathway can be seen in Figure 1.6. The ISC rate equation \\(k_{ISC}\\) can be formed: \\[\\frac{dT_1}{dt} = k_{ISC}S_1\\] Fluourscent emitters have ISC rates on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds (\\(k_{ISC} ~ 10^7s^{-1}\\) (Forget and Chénais 2013), with a timescale of \\(\\tau_{ISC} = 1/k_{ISC}\\). This rate depends strongly on the spin-orbit coupling, as well as the vibrational overlap of the wavefunctions (Stuke 1992).Reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) is the same process in reverse, but it is usually only seen in thermally activated delayed fluorescent materials where the \\(E_{ST}\\) is small.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Intersystem crossing (ISC) displayed in a Jablonski diagram, along with Triplet Absoprtion (TA), and singlet-triplling splitting ΔEST in a conjugated system.\n\n\n\n\n1.4.0.5 Triplet-Triplet Annihilation (TTA)\nOrganic semiconductors under electrical excitation generate triplets at a \\(75\\%\\) chance to \\(25\\%\\) singlets. This means that in these molecules triplet-triplet annihilation plays a major role in the triplet dynamics, especially because triplets are long-lived. The two triplet excitons interact (annihilate) causing a transfer of energy from the first exciton to the second. The excited exciton goes to a higher lying state, which then relaxes so a singlet, triplet, or quintlet state. Although this bimolecular process can be considered a loss, it can also lead to gain via the generation of singlets out of triplets. Hence the focal point of this thesis is \"Can TTA be utilised to manage the triplet states to increase the efficiency of emission such that organic laser diodes can be realised?\". Triplet-triplet annihilation will be discussed in further in Section 1.5.0.3.\n\n\n1.4.0.6 Induced absorption\nPhotons incident upon the conjugated molecule can be quenched by polarons and triplets because of the additional absorption bands. The triplets and polarons care excited to a higher lying state and then relax back to the original position. These losses only substantially affect laser diodes, so it will not be discussed any further. For more information, see Ref. (Lee, Yang, and Greenham 2007) for triplet absorption (TA) and Ref. (Chakaroun et al. 2011) for polaron absorption (PA)."

    "text": "1.5 Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)\nThis thesis has the goal of achieving organic laser diodes; but in order to get there, OLEDs are the more cost efficient and easier method of analysing the emissive layer. This thesis first aims to determine the triplet-triplet annihilation property of an emissive layer, followed up by analysing the success of doping a TTA-exhibiting host with a efficient lasing guest. To do this, fabrication of OLEDs will be able to test the electrical characteristics and performances of these materials.\n\n1.5.0.1 Device structure\nTo pass a current through an organic semiconductor, it has to be sandwiched between an anode and cathode, where we call the entire structure an OLED device. Once a voltage is applied across the electrodes, the electrons and holes diffuse through the layers. The exciton forms on the host, but if a dopant is present within the emissive layer, the exciton transfers to the guest via either Förster resonance energy transfer or by Dexter energy transfer (Duarte 2018; Forget and Chénais 2013). To avoid non-radiative losses (via heat), as shown in Figure 1.1 the host IP is usually larger than the guest HOMO. This enables a minimal barrier for the transferring electron to overcome. Similarly, the cathodes – typically indium tin oxide (ITO) as the anode and aluminium doped with calcium as the cathode – operate better if their work function align with the IP and EA of the organic layers. Matching the energy levels of each layer within an OLED is crucial to efficient device performance. Discussion of the energy levels concerned with this report’s devices can be found in their relevant section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Figure (a) is an example of a simple OLED device with its energy level diagram (b). Holes are injected from the anode into the hole transport layer (HTL) such that the holes then have an easier time entering the emissive layer. Similar to the anode, electrons enter from the cathode into the electron transport layer (ETL). Electrons and holes recombine in the light emitting layer (EML), forming an exciton that has four possible permutations: three triplet states each with a total spin of 1, and one singlet state with a total spin of zero.\n\n\nModern day OLED architectures consist of as many as five or more organic layers (see Figure 1.7 (a)), where each layer helps improve the luminescence efficiency, reduce operational voltage, and improve operational stability (Duarte 2018; Tang and VanSlyke 1987; Adachi et al. 1988). The purpose of these layers were to give fine control over the charge injection, charge transport, electron-hole pair (exciton) diffusion, and photon emission. These improvements led to OLED devices reaching the threshold efficiencies, and some now consider them better than inorganic LEDs.\n\n\n1.5.0.2 Performance characteristics\nIt is extremely useful to define the efficiency of emitted fluorescence photons versus the number of inputted photons or polarons (depending on photoluminescence or electroluminescence). Such a ratio, called the photo/electroluminescence quantum yield \\(\\phi_F(0<\\phi_F<1)\\), enables meaningful discussion about the efficiency of the device and where the losses come from. It is defined as \\[\\phi_F = \\frac{k_r}{k_r+k_{nr}+k_{ISC}}=\\frac{\\tau_nr}{\\tau_{rad}+\\tau_{nr}+\\tau_{ISC}}=\\frac{\\tau_F}{\\tau_{rad}}\\] where \\(\\tau_F\\) is the fluorescence lifetime (Forget and Chénais 2013), a measure of the singlet state’s effective lifetime. The total decay rate \\(k\\) is the sum of the radiative decay \\(k_r\\) and nonradiative decay \\(k_{nr}\\). The total decay rate follows an exponential function, which can be fitted to the time resolved luminescence to estimate the value via \\[I(t) = I_0e^{-kt}\\] where \\(I_0\\) and I(t) is the initial and time response luminescence intensities, respectively. The total efficiency of a device is more than just the fluorescence quantum yield. This external quantum efficiency (EQE) is the total performance efficiency of the device that is given by \\[\\phi_{EQE} = \\gamma \\phi_{spin}\\phi_F\\eta_{out}\\] where \\(\\gamma\\) is a factor describing how often charges recombine in the emissive layer (usually \\(\\gamma \\approx 1\\)), \\(\\phi_{spin}\\) is the singlet-triplet spin probability factor (in fluorescence \\(\\phi_{spin} ~ 0.25\\)), and \\(\\eta_{out}\\) is a factor describing the percentage of light escaping the device (usually \\(\\phi_{out} ~ 20-25\\%\\)). \\(\\gamma\\) and \\(\\eta_{out}\\) are altered via the device architecture, while \\(\\phi_F\\) and \\(\\phi_{spin}\\) are altered via the emissive layer. To put it into context for this report, one focus is to choose the right emissive layer to obtain high \\(\\phi_F\\) and \\(\\phi_{spin}\\) and by proxy a high EQE. In this thesis, \\(\\phi_{spin}\\) will be increased by utilising TTA, the process that generates extra singlet excitons from the triplets. \\(\\phi_F\\) is low for TTA materials, so hence why it will be doped with a more efficient lasing material.\nOLEDs also need to consider operational lifetime, a key attribute that is directly proportional to the degradation of the devices due to losses such as localized heating, material decomposition, and Coulombic degradation (Aziz et al. 1999; T.-H. Liu, Iou, and Chen 2003; Lin et al. 2001; Meerheim et al. 2006; Jiang et al. 2007; Cester et al. 2010). If the luminance efficiency is increased and thus reduces the current needed to achieve a target brightness, the operational lifetime is increased. This is why it is so important to try and reduce the current input, especially for electrically pumped lasers. A typical OLED display operates at around \\(0.01 A cm^{-2}\\); a typical inorganic semiconductor laser diode operates at a current density of \\(1000 A cm^{-2}\\) (Samuel and Turnbull 2007). Hence decreasing the current-density threshold by making the device more efficient is necessary to achieving lasing. This is part of the motivation for this thesis.\n\n\n1.5.0.3 Types of emissive layers\nAny light emitted from electrical injected we label as electroluminescence (photoluminescence for optically pumped). To compare all the different ways emissive layers electroluminesce, the layers are labelled depending on their emission pathway. Light emission via singlet exciton decay is labelled as fluorescence. Because fluorescent materials can only emit photons from the singlet excited state (Duarte 2018; Forget and Chénais 2013; Adachi and Sandanayaka 2020), their internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is limited to \\(25\\%\\). We do not see emission from the triplet excites states because the nonradiative decay out-competes radiative decay at room temperature (Adachi and Sandanayaka 2020). At low temperatures, triplet-state emission is possible, but is impractical. Up until 1997, most light emitting devices used fluorescent materials.\nOrganic phosphorescent dopants were discovered to be able to emit photons from the decay of triplet excited states due to strong spin-orbit coupling, which led to high IQEs. They also have fast rates of singlet-triplet intersystem crossing (ISC). This meant that these phosphorescent materials could be used as a guest to extract the triplets and singlet excited states via Dexter energy transfer from the host. IQEs of up to \\(100\\%\\) were achievable (Adachi et al. 2001; Baldo et al. 1999). Phosphorescent materials struggle at achieving operational stability compared to fluorescent materials, especially in the blue emission regime (Zhang, Lee, and Forrest 2014).\nThermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters offer an alternative way to harness the triplets than phosphorescent materials. In TADF materials, the splitting \\(\\Delta E_{ST}\\) between the singlet and triplet excited-states enables the triplet exciton to transfer to the singlet state via an efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. The process needs thermal energy to transfer between energy states; so typical TADF materials have a splitting of less than \\(0.5 eV\\) such that the thermal energy from room temperature suffices. Thus in a TADF emitter, the initial singlet excitons decay radiatively with a prompt emission (nanosecond timescale), which is then followed by a delayed emission from the triplet-to-singlet RISC decay (microsecond to millisecond timescale).\nFigure 1.8 compares the emission mechanism in fluorescent, phosphorescent, and TADF emitters in a Jablonski diagram. Understanding these dynamics of exciton population and emission pathways is crucial to obtaining an efficient device. In terms of organic lasing, the long decay lifetimes of triplet states are the biggest disadvantage for phosphorescence, along with its scarcity and expensiveness of its materials. The TADF pathway has slow reverse intersystem crossing, which means that any realisation of lasing through this pathway will be unstable because of the slow singlet formation. On the other hand, fluorescent emitters have short excited-state lifetimes as well as comparatively higher radiative rates. The issue of course with fluorescent emitters is their IQE of \\(25\\%\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: The decay mechanisms for singlet and triplet excitons within fluorescent, phosphorescent, and TADF emitters in a Jablonksi diagram. As well as the nonradiative decay (NRD) pathway in all emitters. The diagram features the lowest vibrational level of the singlet states S0 (ground state) as well as the first singlet S1 and triplet T1 excited state. Intersystem Crossing (ISC) and Reverse Intersystem Crossing (RISC) occur between S1 and T1. It also features the recombination of holes and electrons to form the exciton quasi-particle and their subsequent exciton formation probability: 75% to triplets and 25% to singlets\n\n\n\n\n1.5.0.4 Triplet-triplet Upconversion\nThis now enables the introduction of the pathway considered in this thesis: triplet-triplet upconversion (TTU). Similar to TADF materials, this pathway has a prompt component and a delayed component. The prompt emission comes from the direct singlet exciton, while the delayed emission comes after two triplets annihilate together (via triplet-triplet annihilation, TTA) and produce a singlet that then radiatively decays. Triplet-triplet upconversion-based OLEDs have realised external quantum efficiencies of \\(10\\%\\) as opposed to the theoretical limit of fluorescence-based OLEDs of \\(5\\%\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: The life of an exciton from formation (charge recombination) to decay via different pathways. Triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) with rate constant γTTA involves one triplet non-radiatively decaying to the ground state, and the other being promoted to an intermediate state. The intermediate state then generates 1/4 singlets and 3/4 triplets, with the Triplets being able to be recycled.\n\n\nTriplet-triplet annihilation has two colliding triplet states leading to an intermediate state with twice the energy of the \\(T_1\\) state. The intermediate states can then lead to one singlet state, three triplet states, and five quintet states (Wallikewitz et al. 2012). This quintet state can be formed due to conservation of total spin angular momentum, but typically has much higher energy than the two triplet states at room temperature (Köhler and Bässler 2009; Pope and Swenberg 1982; Zhang and Forrest 2012); so the pathways for the intermediate state are the higher-lying triplet \\(T_n\\) state or to a singlet state \\(S_1\\) (see Appendix [apen:A]). Writing it mathematically, the pathways are (Wallikewitz et al. 2012; Zhang and Forrest 2012; Pope and Swenberg 1982) \\[\\label{eq:1}\n    T_1 + T_1 \\rightarrow T_n + S_0 \\rightarrow T_1+S_0\\] or \\[\\label{eq:2}\n    T_1 + T_1 \\rightarrow S_1 + S_0\\] The generated triplets from the triplet pathway can be recycled back into further TTA. So assuming no other decay channels for triplets, the maximum fraction of singlets \\(f_{singlets}\\) from this series of TTA is \\[f_{singlets} = \\frac{f}{2} \\sum_{n=0}^{n=\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1-f}{2} \\right)^n = f\\frac{1-f}{1+f}\\] where \\(f\\) is the fraction of \\(S_1\\) singlets being formed from one TTA event (Wallikewitz et al. 2012). If \\(f=25\\%\\), \\(f_{singlets}=15\\%\\). In some new anthracene derivatives, two triplet states have less energy than the higher lying \\(T_n\\) state. This means the triplet pathway is unreachable and only the singlet pathway can be accessed. In this scenario, \\(f=50\\), so the maximum singlet generation can be \\(S_{25\\%}+(T_{75\\%}\\times TTA_{50\\%} = 62.5\\%\\). This leads to a maximum EQE of \\(12.5\\%\\), but this pathway is restricted to a few materials (Ieuji, Goushi, and Adachi 2019).\nThe rate constant of TTA \\(\\gamma_{TTA}\\) can be paired with \\(f\\) to create the rate constants of each pathway \\(f\\gamma_{TTA}\\) and \\((1-f)\\gamma{TTA}\\). To develop full singlet and triplet density dynamics, singlet-triplet annihilation (STA) needs to be included in our model (Zhang and Forrest 2012). STA has the pathway (Pope and Swenberg 1982) \\[\\label{eq:3}\n    T + S \\rightarrow T + S_0\\] with the rate constant \\(k_{ST}\\). The full dynamics are therefore \\[\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\gamma(J) \\frac{J}{4ed} - (k_s+k_{s.nr}+k_{ISC}S - k_{ST}ST + f\\gamma_{TTA}T^2\\] and \\[\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\gamma(J) \\frac{3J}{4ed} - k_{T,nr}T - k_{ISC}S - (1-f)\\gamma_{TTA}T^2\\] where TTU has a rate \\(\\gamma_{TTU}=f\\gamma_{TTA}T^2\\) (process ([eq:1])), process ([eq:2]) has a rate of \\((1-f)\\gamma_{TTA}T^2\\), process ([eq:3]) has a rate \\(k_{ST}ST\\), \\(\\gamma(J)\\) is the charge balance factor (Giebink and Forrest 2008; Ruhstaller et al. 2001), \\(e\\) is the electron charge, \\(d\\) is the emissive layer thickness, and \\(k_s\\) and \\(k_T\\) are the singlet and triplet natural decay rates. These dynamic equations can be solved in two limiting stead-state conditions (Wallikewitz et al. 2012; Qiao et al. 2017; Monguzzi et al. 2008). TTA is distance-dependent between the neighbouring triplets in solid films, such that at low current density when minimal triplet exciton population the mini-triplet decay dominates over the bimolecular triplet annihilation (\\(k{T,nr}T\\gg \\gamma_{TTU}T^2\\)). Setting \\(\\gamma(J)\\frac{J}{4edk_{T,nr}} \\equiv T_{G}\\), the triplet population is \\(T = \\frac{T_G}{k_{T,nr}}\\) such that the singlet population from TTU in a neat film is \\[S = \\frac{\\gamma_{TTU}}{k_{T,nr}+k_S}T^2\\] such that the luminance L is proportional to current density by \\[L \\propto J^2\\] In steady state, the EQE can be calculated via \\(EQE(J) = \\eta_{out}\\phi_{F} \\frac{k_sS(J)}{J/(ed)}\\), such that at low current density the EQE is proportional to current density by \\[EQE \\propto J\\]\nAt increasing current density, the triplet excitons become abundant and the bimolecular process dominates the dynamics (\\(k{T,nr}T\\ll \\gamma_{TTU}T^2\\)). In this regime, the \\(L\\propto J\\) and the EQE becomes insensitive to current, meaning the usual EQE roll-off would occur. The quadratic dependence on J at low current densities transitions to the a linear dependence above the critical triplet density \\(T{transition}\\>(k_{TTU}\\tau)^-1\\) (Engmann et al. 2019) (see Figure 1.10)\n\n\n\nFigure 1.10: The two regimes of triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion at low and high current densities. The transition point Jth happens at the critical triplet density Ttransition (kTTUτ)−1. The graph is a log-log plot.\n\n\n\n\n1.5.1 Measurement of OLED performance\nTo analyse OLEDs performance, such as efficiency, there are numerous performance characteristics that can be assessed. To record measurements for an OLED, we can apply a voltage in direct current (DC) operation or alternating current (AC) via a pulse. The main measurement variables are voltage (V), current density (\\(mA/cm^2\\)), and luminance/brightness (\\(cd/m^2\\)), with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) needing to be calculated from these measurements.\n\n1.5.1.1 DC measurements\nIn DC measurements, typically measurements of the main three variables are done over a range of voltages to construct a current density-voltage-luminance, or J-V-L, graph. In training, I created an OLED with Super Yellow, poly(phenylenevinylene), as the emissive layer. Its J-V-L graph shows the natural increase in current density as voltage is increased – luminance follows suit too. For the external quantum efficiency, there usually is a peak EQE for a certain current density. This is after current density is able to produce sufficient excitons but before losses start settling in. In this case, STA and polaron quenching dominate and cause the typical EQE roll off.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.11: Performance characteristics for two common poly(phenylenevinylene) (Super Yellow) devices [ITO (100nm)/PEDOT (30nm)/Super Yellow (70nm)/Calcium (5nm)/Aluminium (60nm)] that was made as part of training. a) Typical current density-luminance-voltage (J-V-L) graph. b) EQE as a function of current density.\n\n\n\n\n1.5.1.2 Pulse Measurements\nAt high current densities, OLEDs experience degradation due to Joule heating, an effect that causes dark spots on the emitting pixel area of the OLED. Under DC measurement, Joule heating is amplified. So it becomes essential to not only use short voltage pulse to one avoid Joule heating, but also to observe transient electroluminescence. This is useful because triplet excitons, because they are long-lived, can be reduced under pulse regime. This leads to reduction in induced absoprtion losses. In other words, a pulse measurement can achieve a high singlet population before the triplet excitons approach a steady-stage. The rates of bimolecular process, as well as decay rates, can be analysed and calculated via the transient pulse electroluminescence. No calculations are done in this thesis, but inclusion of this sets the foundation for the next step.\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Organic semiconductor lasers\nDespite this thesis not containing any fabrication of lasers, it is still important to discuss what a laser is and how organic semiconductors can achieve lasing. Lasing was first achieved using ruby crystals (Maiman 1960), with organic molecules following close after with optically pumped lasers (Soffer and McFarland 1967; Lemmer et al. 1999). It was not until 1996 that the first organic semiconductor solid-state laser was developed (Hide et al. 1996), which was the first step towards reaching organic semiconductor lasers (OSL) that are able to display the entire visible spectrum. OSLs are even at the stage of demonstrating lasing while on flexible substrates (Kallinger et al. 1998) and low-threshold operation (Vasdekis et al. 2006), but no stable electrically pumped lasers. In this section, optically pumped lasers will be elucidated.\n\n1.5.2.1 Optical gain\nAn external light source pumps an amplification (gain) medium, where population inversion occurs between two states. Two-level mediums are not practical for lasing, so the four-level system is employed to obtain low-threshold operation. Such a four-level system has an optical excitation from the ground state \\(\\ket{1}\\) to a the excited state \\(\\ket{2}\\) (see Figure 1.12). The excited state relaxes to a lower excited state \\(\\ket{2}\\) that decays radiatively via the laser transition (3). This means the \\(\\ket{3}\\) state has to the most populated state and the \\(\\ket{2}\\) state be virtually unpopulated because of its fast lifetime. Population inversion is when state \\(\\ket{3}\\) has a higher population than state \\(\\ket{4}\\). When this inversion happens, stimulated emission can be achieved, where an incoming photon resonates with the excited state and causes a radiative decay with the same wavelength, polarization, phase, and direction as the incoming photon. This process is \"stimulated\" because it needs an incident photon and it results in coherent light.\nIn organic semiconductors, this process happens between the excitonic ground state \\(S_0\\) and the excited singlet state \\(S_1\\), along with their higher vibrational levels. Hence, organic semiconductors are inherently four-level systems.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.12: Left: A Jablonski diagram that shows the pathways of a four-level system. Radiative transfers of energy are the (1) and (3) pathway; (2) and (4) are relaxation process. Right: the intrinsic four-level system of an organic semiconductor is due to the additional vibronic energy levels at the ground state and excited state."

    "text": "1.6 Laser Structures\nThere are a few different resonator types that enable lasing, such as planar micro-cavities, Fabry-Perot cavities, micro-ring, microdisk, and microspherical resonators. Though distributed feedback (DFB) resonators can tune the wavelength by altering the period the light travels in the optical gain material. This is done by changing the film thickness to alter the effective refractive index. A simple OSL structure is shown in Figure 1.12.\nA simple organic semiconductor laser needs to have lower losses than the total gain/amplification to achieve lasing. This total gain is dependent on the stimulated emission cross-section \\(\\sigma_{em}\\). The losses depend on reabsorption or other exciton quenching pathways, as well as cavity losses. The lasing condition is the electric field \\(E_0\\) of the confined light being able to replicate the same path \\[E_0 = E_0 exp(i4\\pi nL/\\lambda_0)\\sqrt{R_1R_2e^{2L(g-\\alpha)}}\\] where \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) are the reflectivities of the mirrors \\(L\\) distance apart, \\(\\lambda_0\\) is the vacuum wavelength, \\(g\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) are the modal gain and loss respectively (Hill and Gather 2014). There must be intervals of acceptable length L because of the imaginary component. This condition can be written \\[L = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{2n}m\\] where m is an integer. As mentioned previously, the modal gain \\(g\\) must be higher than the combines losses, written mathematically (Hill and Gather 2014) \\[g \\geq \\alpha - \\frac{ln(R_1R_2)}{2L}\\] To understand gain better, a look at the population dynamics of the levels. Spontaneous emission from \\(S_1\\) to \\(S_0\\) \\(N_{10}\\) is governed by \\[\\partial N_{10} = N_1A_{10}\\partial t\\] but is changed when undergoing stimulated emission: \\[\\partial N_{10} = N_1u(\\lambda)B_{10}\\partial t\\] where \\(N_1\\) is the poulation of the \\(S_1\\) state, \\(u(\\lambda)\\) is the photon density, and \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the Einstein coefficients. Because stimulated emission is now dependent on the Einstein coefficient \\(B\\), the gain of the material is now too. And because \\(B \\propto \\sigma_{em}\\), we have \\[\\sigma_{em} = \\frac{\\lambda^4E_f(\\lambda)}{8\\pi n^2c\\tau_f}\\] where \\(n\\) is the average refractive index of the gain medium, \\(c\\) is the speed of light, \\(\\tau_f\\) is the fluorescence lifetime of the emissive lyaer, and \\(E_f(\\lambda)\\) is the spectral distribution of its PLQY. From this formula, we can see to optimise the stimulated-emission cross section, and hence the gain, a low \\(\\tau_f\\) (fast decay) and high PLQY with narrow spectra is needed.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.13: A mirror, gain medium, semi-transparent mirror, and an external pump source all comprise the basics of a laser.\n\n\n\n1.6.0.1 Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)\nWithout needing to build a cavity, the prospect for lasing can be evaluated by use of a simple waveguided structure that enables a weak but intrinsic optical feedback. ASE still sees spectral narrowing of the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM), but does not exhibit coherent emission out. This is because, while population inversion has occurred, spontaneous emission dominates the system instead of stimulation emission.\n\n\n\n\nAdachi, Chihaya, Marc A. Baldo, Mark E.
