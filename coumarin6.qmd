#  TTU in a Host-Guest system to enhance Coumarin6 {#sec-c6}

## Introduction

In this section, I preliminary investigated the electroluminescence
properties of a model anthracene derivative 2,6-diphenylanthracene
(2,6-DPA) [@RN39; @RN141] doped in a known lasing material,
3-(2-Benzothiazolyl)-N,N-diethylumbelliferylamine (Coumarin6)
[@RN35; @RN126] at $~1-2wt\%$. Coumarin caan be confied between the
large singlet-triplet energy level gap of 2,6-DPA, which enables
transfer of singlets to the guest, and triplets from the guest to host
for further TTU (see Figure [@fig:ttucoumarin]). The OLED structure can
be found in Appendix
[\[apen:oledex\]](#apen:oledex){reference-type="ref"
reference="apen:oledex"}. 2,6-DPA/Coumarin6 was based in OLEDs that were
then tested and analysed under steady state and microsecond pulse
excitation. The low $wt\%$ of Coumarin6 guest is to avoid separation of
the chromophores of 2,6-DPA. That way the Dexter energy transfer of
triplet-triplet annihilation can happen frequently. A similar doping
approach has been used to obtain high EQEs due to TTU [@RN73], and
reduce STA in optically pumped lasers [@RN149]. Herein, I found that
2,6-DPA/Coumarin6 host/guest exhibits the TTU mechanism to generate
extra singlet excitons, yet does not achieve a better performance than
non-doped. At low-current densities (J) the EQE of the device increases
proportionally to $J$ because of the absence of dominating
singlet-triplet annihilation (STA). At high current densities, STA
becomes a significant loss causing a reduction in EQE and gain. The
transition between the dominating regions of
$T{transition}\>(k_{TTU}\tau)^-1$ and the inverse are clearly visible,
yet the transient electroluminescence does not demonstrate promising
results. Herein, I will explain the promise of these preliminary results
regarding TTU and coumarin6.

### Results

The OLED devices that were creates followed the structure, Indium Tin
Oxide (ITO) 100nm /
N,N'-Di(1-naphthyl)-N,N'-diphenyl-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diamine (NPB)
40nm / 2,6-DPA and Coumarin6 ( 1-2wt%) 40nm /
1,3,5-Tris(3-pyridyl-3-phenyl)benzene (TmPyPB) 30nm / Calcium 5nm /
Aluminum 100nm. Each layer was thermally evaporated under high vacuum
($10^-6 mbar)$ without break to avoid atmosphere exposure. The
deposition rate for the organic layers were between $0.3 - 0.6 Å/s$.
To achieve $~1-2wt\%$ , a simultaneous doping of coumarin6 and 2,6-DPA
deposition with rates $0.01Å/s$ and $1Å/s$ minimum was required.
The thermal evaporator's smallest deposition rate was $0.01Å/s$ so
this become quite troublesome to manage. Exceeding $1Å/s$ is not
preferable due to piercing of the beneath layer. The thickness and
structure was chosen as per the OLEDs made in the previous section to best compare device performance difference.
The spectra showed a pale green emission (peak 520 nm).

Four neat film devices were fabricated each having eight pixels (four
$0.75mm^2$ and four $0.3mm^2$). Due to faulty contacts, thermal
evaporation alignment issues, and scratches or blemishes on the
substrate window some pixels become unable to be tested. Others can
degrade whilst a voltage is applied. In these doped-OLEDs, a majority
were unstable due to fabrication issues. A few pixels managed to
survive. A turn-on voltage of $3.6\pm0.2$ V was achieved at the defined
$1 cd/m^2$, with the maximum brightness approaching $2300\pm1000 cd/m^2$
at $10\pm0.2$ V. The large uncertainty for maximum brightness is too
account for minimal pixel survival rate. The J-V-L characteristics of
the doped film and the EQE versus current density graph can be found in
@fig-cjvl and @fig-ceqe. A roll up of EQE
(peak $0.16\pm0.10$%) until $~500\pm200 mA/cm^2$ demonstrates early
triplet-triplet upconversion gain (see @fig-ceqe). The peak EQE of
this device, however, do not exceed the theoretical maximum EQE of
$~2.25\%$. It also is noticeably lower than 2,6-DPA neat film. This
could be due to failure to achieve $1-2wt\%$ because of limitations with
the thermal evaporator. It could also be device structure that might not
present good injection of charges. The doped film exhibits similar
luminance-current density trends with its distinct two-regimes of slope
$>1$ and $<1$ (see @fig-cslope). The transition current density is roughly
$900\pm100 mA/cm^2$. The slope is $<2$ due to imperfect TTU and losses,
such as STA and other quenching. An observed slope shift from $>1$ to
$<1$ indicates definite gain of triplet to singlet excitons.

Pulse measurements (transient electroluminescence) will demonstrate the
population dynamics of the excitons even to high current densities. The
device area used was $0.7mm^2$ to reduce geometrical capacitance that
minimises RC response distortion. For doped films, a long pulse width
($1.5\mu s$) was used to extrapolate the affect STA had on fluorescent
materials at high current densities. Whilst DC measurements only reached
current densities of $1 A/cm^2$, pulse measurements reach densities of
$>2.5 A/cm^2$. At high current densities, doped and non-doped devices
show a sharp rise, characteristic of space charge limited current
conditions), with the initial rise lifetime of $~80 ns$. This is
characteristic of TTU devices because of the recycling nature of the
triplet excitons generating additional singlets. At high current
densities (40 V) the steady state shows decrease over time, indicating
STA has dominated rate over the TTU generation rate (see @fig-cslope). This decrease is
more than the neat-film, indicating that TTU either is not as present or
STA is more dominant. At lower current densities, STA is not prevalent
so a steady state is visible. STA dominates via FRET, a process that is
determined by the spectral overlap between $S_1$ emission and
$T_1\rightarrow T_n$ absorption bands.

:::


The turn off electroluminescence of pulse measurements also provide
useful information. For TTU devices, a prompt decay is expected after
voltage turn off due to the loss of direct singlet generation, followed
by a delayed fluorescence (DF) bimolecular decay function
$$EL_{DF} = \frac{1}{(a+bt)^2}$$ where $a$ and $b$ are constants. This
characteristic slope of $~2$ in a log-log plot can be observed in these
doped devices at low current density. The delayed component is $~61\%$
of the steady state (near TTU max) at $15V$.

### Discussion

2,6-DPA is an anthracene derivative with low PLQY and moderate charge
mobility in amorphous state. It can be doped with a higher PLQY material
to improve the overall efficiency. In neat film OLEDs, 2,6-DPA shows
distinctive TTU properties such as distinctive regimes as seen in
the mCBP OLEDs. This chapter uses the TTU property of 2,6-DPA
to transfer singlets to Coumarin6 via FRET (see @fig-ttucoumarin). A low $wt\%$ Coumarin6 was doped as to
not separate the chromophores of 2,6-DPA, such that it would not extend
the triplet states beyond the short-range Dexter energy transfer
process. This was successful as the doped OLED showed trends of TTU.
Despite the peak EQE not surpassing the theoretical maximum of typical
fluorescent emitters -- a feat that would confirm extra exciton
generation -- the evidence presented here is a good start in showing
this doped system exhibits TTU. To increase device performance,
optimisation of fabrication process and device structure needs to be
considered specific to an a 2,6-DPA/Coumarin6 host-guest systems.
Further optimisation of the thermal evaporation process would also
increase the pixel survivability and stability.
