In this feature article we overview the characteristics of organic single-crystal light-emitting field-effect transistors (OSCLEFETs). The contents include the single crystal growth of organic semiconductors and their application to transistor devices. First, we describe various single crystal growth methods that produce different morphologies and geometries of crystals. Using these single crystals we highlight construction and performance of the devices. The single crystal approach not only allows us to study the device performance that reflects the intrinsic nature of the organic semiconductors but also is advantageous to enhancement in the steady device operation. A current-injected laser oscillation in an electronic device configuration remains as a big challenge to be achieved. In this context we briefly mention the spectrally narrowed emissions as well as the possibility of light amplification in the OSCLEFETs.},

   pages = {5008},
   abstract = {Organic light-emitting diodes are a major driving force of the current information display revolution due to their low power consumption and potentially long operational lifetime. Although electrophosphorescent organic emitters have significantly lower power consumption than fluorescent emitters, the short lifetime of electrophosphorescent blue devices has prevented their application in displays for more than a decade. Here, we demonstrate a novel blue electrophosphorescent device with a graded dopant concentration profile in a broadened emissive layer, leading to a lower exciton density compared with a conventional device. Thus, triplet-polaron annihilation that leads to long-term luminescent degradation is suppressed, resulting in a more than threefold lifetime improvement. When this strategy is applied to a two-unit stacked device, we demonstrate a lifetime of 616±10 h (time to 80 of the 1,000cdm−2 initial luminance) with chromaticity coordinates of [0.15, 0.29], representing a tenfold lifetime improvement over a conventional blue electrophosphorescent device.},

   abstract = {We study triplet exciton diffusion in the archetype organic material 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)biphenyl (CBP) commonly used as a conductive host in the emissive zone of organic light emitting devices. Using time-resolved spectral decay ensuing from the diffusion of an initially localized triplet population to a spatially separated phosphor doped region, we model the delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence decays based on non-dispersive triplet transport. Fits to the model yield a diffusion coefficient of D=(1.4±0.3)×10−8cm2/s, and a triplet–triplet bimolecular quenching rate constant of KTT=(1.6±0.4)×10−14cm3/s. The results are extended by doping a wide energy-gap molecule into CBP that serves to frustrate triplet transport, lowering both the diffusion coefficient and annihilation rate. These results are used to model a recently demonstrated white organic light emitting device that depends on triplet diffusion in CBP to excite spatially separate fluorescent and phosphorescent doped regions of the emissive layer. We determine the extent to which diffusion contributes to light emission in this structure, and predict its performance based on ideal lumophores with unity quantum yield.},

   abstract = {Phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence of polyfluorene polymer films doped with cyclooctatetraene (COT) and anthracene are studied by means of time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The occurrence of an anomalous nonvertical triplet energy transfer in solid conjugated polymer films is demonstrated for the first time employing the "nonvertical" COT triplet acceptor, which appears to behave similarly to conventional vertical triplet acceptors, such as anthracene. Both dopant molecules are found to efficiently quench the host phosphorescence of the polymer without affecting the host fluorescence--this can be attributed to the large singlet-triplet (S(1)-T(1)) splitting of these molecules. This S(1)-T(1) splitting is exceptionally large in COT due to its low-lying relaxed triplet state, which is capable of accepting host triplet excitations. In contrast to anthracene, the triplet lifetime of the COT molecules is reasonably short, thus making a fast deactivation of the triplet excitations possible. This suggests that nonvertical triplet scavengers might be promising candidates for quenching the host triplet excitations in future electrically pumped fluorescence organic lasers, which suffer from excessive triplet-state losses.},

   abstract = {In Dye Lasers: 25 years, the pioneers and leading experts in the field of dye lasers present the current status and bright future perspectives of dye lasers and their applications in physics and chemistry. Particular topics covered include: new sources of ultrashort pulses, novel aspects of resonator design and imaging for femtosecond lasers, amplification schemes to terawatt intensity regimes, optics and high-resolution spectroscopy of atoms and molecules, and electro-optic and plasma physics applications of ultrashort and ultra-intense laser pulses. Since its invention in 1966, the dye laser has revolutionized many fields of science and technology. Questions of fundamental interest in physics and chemistry can now be answered: it is possible to test fundamental quantum physics in single-atom experiments and regioselective photochemistry in complexes can be monitored directlyusing dye-laser diagnostic methods. In this book the latest results (and most recent references) are presented for new sources of ultrashort pulses from the visible to the VUV, together with experimental details of ultrahigh-resolution spectroscopy of atoms and molecules, laser diagnostics of the dynamics of elementary chemical reactions, and ultrahigh intensity sources for laser target interaction.},

   abstract = {Device Architecture and Materials for Organic Light-Emitting Devices focuses on the design of new device and material concepts for organic light-emitting devices, thereby targeting high current densities and an improved control of the triplet concentration. A new light-emitting device architecture, the OLED with field-effect electron transport, is demonstrated. This device is a hybrid between a diode and a field-effect transistor. Compared to conventional OLEDs, the metallic cathode is displaced by one to several micrometers from the light-emitting zone, reducing optical absorption losses. The electrons injected by the cathode accumulate at an organic heterojunction and are transported to the light-emission zone by field-effect. High mobilities for charge carriers are achieved in this way, enabling a high current density and a reduced number of charge carriers in the device. Pulsed excitation experiments show that pulses down to 1 µs can be applied to this structure without affecting the light intensity, suggesting that pulsed excitation might be useful to reduce the accumulation of triplets in the device. The combination of all these properties makes the OLED with field-effect electron transport particularly interesting for waveguide devices and future electrically pumped lasers. In addition, triplet-emitter doped organic materials, as well as the use of triplet scavengers in conjugated polymers are investigated.},

Many doped conducting organic polymers with conductivity spanning the range from insulator to near-metallic ∼10−15–103 ohm−1cm−1) are now known1–13. Of prime importance and fundamental interest in the continuing experimental and theoretical search for new conducting, and perhaps superconducting, polymers is the achievement of small or vanishing values for the semiconductor band gap (Eg), which governs the intrinsic electronic, optical and magnetic properties of materials. Existence of a finite Eg in conjugated polymers is thought to originate principally from bond-length alternation, which is related to the Peierls instability theorem for one-dimensional metals114–17. Here I describe a novel class of conjugated polymers, containing alternating aromatic and quinonoid segments, whose members exhibit intrinsic band gaps as low as 0.75 eV, the smallest known value of Eg for an organic polymer.},

We address the question of whether this fraction can principally exceed the fundamental limit set down by spin statistics, which requires the possibility of spin changes during exciton formation. Sensitized phosphorescence at 4-300 K enables a direct quantification of spin conversion in coulombically bound electron-hole pairs, the precursors to exciton formation. These are stabilized in external electric fields over times relevant to carrier transport, capture and recombination in devices. No interconversion of exciton intermediates between singlet and triplet configurations is observed. Static magnetic fields are equally unable to induce spin mixing in electroluminescence. Our observations imply substantial exchange splitting at all times during carrier capture. Prior statements regarding increased singlet yields above 25 merely on the basis of higher singlet than triplet formation rates should therefore be re-examined.},

   abstract = {Triplet excitons are ubiquitous in organic optoelectronics, but they are often an undesirable energy sink because they are spin-forbidden from emitting light and their high binding energy hinders the generation of free electron–hole pairs. Harvesting their energy is consequently an important technological challenge. Here, we demonstrate direct excitonic energy transfer from ‘dark’ triplets in the organic semiconductor tetracene to colloidal PbS nanocrystals, thereby successfully harnessing molecular triplet excitons in the near infrared. Steady-state excitation spectra, supported by transient photoluminescence studies, demonstrate that the transfer efficiency is at least (90 ± 13). The mechanism is a Dexter hopping process consisting of the simultaneous exchange of two electrons. Triplet exciton transfer to nanocrystals is expected to be broadly applicable in solar and near-infrared light-emitting applications, where effective molecular phosphors are lacking at present. In particular, this route to ‘brighten’ low-energy molecular triplet excitons may permit singlet exciton fission sensitization of conventional silicon solar cells.},

We describe experimental results using polymers, polymer blends and triplet emitters in an LED configuration using either CW or pulsed mode of operation. We also describe results of modeling such structures with the aim of being able to design electrical and optical characteristics of future laser structures. Finally we describe an approach to modify material parameters so as to provide a range of building blocks for optoelectronic devices.},

   abstract = {Today's technology is not possible without optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes, transistors and solar cells. These basic units of modern electronic appliances may be made not only from traditional inorganic semiconductors, but also from organic semiconductors, i.e. hydrocarbon molecules that combine semiconducting properties with some mechanical properties such as easy processability and flexibility. The weak van der Waals forces that bind the molecules to a solid imply a low dielectric constant, so that coulomb and exchange interactions between electrons are significant. As a result, photoexcitation or electrical excitation results in strongly bound electron–hole pairs, so-called excitons. Depending on the relative orientation of the electron and hole spin, the exciton may be of a overall singlet or triplet spin state. While the fluorescent singlet state has been investigated intensively since the first reports of organic electroluminescence, research into the properties of the phosphorescent triplet state has intensified mainly during the last decade. In this review we give an overview on the photophysical processes associated with the formation of triplet states and their decay, as well as the energy levels and energy transfer processes of triplet states. We aim to give a careful introduction for those new to this particular research area as well as to highlight some of the current research issues and intriguing questions for those familiar with the field. The main focus of this review is on molecular assemblies and polymer films, though relevant work on molecular crystals is also included where it assists in forming a larger picture.},

   abstract = {Triplet–triplet upconversion, in which two triplet excitons are converted to one singlet exciton, is a well-known approach to exceed the limit of electroluminescence quantum efficiency in conventional fluorescence-based organic light-emitting diodes. Considering the spin multiplicity of triplet pairs, upconversion efficiency is usually limited to 20. Although this limit can be exceeded when the energy of a triplet pair is lower than that of a second triplet excited state, such as for rubrene, it is generally difficult to engineer the energy levels of higher triplet excited states. Here, we investigate the upconversion efficiency of a series of new anthracene derivatives with different substituents. Some of these derivatives show upconversion efficiencies close to 50 even though the calculated energy levels of the second triplet excited states are lower than twice the lowest triplet energy. A possible upconversion mechanism is proposed based on the molecular structures and quantum chemical calculations.},

   abstract = {Excitons dominate the optoelectronic properties of organic devices. Normal organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) generally linearly use exciton to generate electroluminescence (EL), in which one photon is produced from per exciton. Eliminating bi-excitons quenching is of great concern for efficient devices. Here, we have theoretically and experimentally investigated a non-linear EL process mediated by triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) in rubrene/C60-based OLEDs. This non-linear EL process realizes the electrically pumped up-conversion by promoting two low-energy triplet excitons into one high-energy exciton, thus extremely lowering the working voltage of resulting OLEDs. It is clearly seen that this up-conversion EL intensity essentially exhibits two distinct regimes at different current densities, i.e. a quadratic dependence at low current density where mono-triplet decay is dominant, and a linear dependence at high current density where bi-triplet decay becomes dominant. These results further our understanding of the non-linear optoelectronic process. In particular, our results demonstrate that energetically utilizing the TTA provides possibility of fabricating low-driving voltage, high efficiency OLEDs via non-linear EL process.},

Highly efficient devices (6–9 external quantum efficiencies) based on 9,10-bis(2-naphthyl)-2-phenylanthracene show that the TTA contribution depends primarily on operating current density, reaching as much as 20–30 of the overall emission intensity at moderate current densities (>5 mA/cm2). Revision of the classical estimates of maximum external quantum efficiency of fluorescent OLEDs to 8 and maximum internal quantum efficiency to 40 is recommended to account for TTA contribution (even further revision may be necessary to account for a better-than-20 optical outcoupling).},

   abstract = {Organic semiconductors with optoelectronic properties have attracted intensive interests in the fields of organic light-emitting diodes, organic photovoltaics and organic photodetectors. In these functional devices, exciton evolution is the key process. Generally, linear process is dominant that one photon is created from each injected electron-hole pair, vice versa. This linear process restricts the internal quantum efficiency to be 100 in optoelectronic devices. Alternatively, nonlinear optoelectronic processes, like triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) and singlet fission (SF), can theoretically break the limitation stated in linear optoelectronic processes. TTA and SF are two dynamic reversible processes, which link one high-lying energy singlet with two low-lying energy triplet excitons on two neighboring chromophores. These nonlinear processes bring the possibility of novel functions and application scenarios, and hence have attracted more and more attentions recently. This review will systematically and comparatively summarize the basic properties of TTA and SF processes, and their applications in optoelectronic devices in the view of device physics. It starts with a concise introduction of basic knowledge of TTA and SF. Then, the characteristics used to identify these processes are described. Subsequently, implementing them in OLEDs are summarized, followed by the application examples in OPVs. Emphasis is laid on the triplet quenching mechanisms in working devices, since both TTA and SF processes highly rely on triplet excitons. These discussions on the recent important progresses aim to gain some insight into the device physics for device engineering. Finally, a perspective is presented.},

   abstract = {Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) often face the issue of decreasing power efficiency with increasing brightness. Loss of charge carrier balance is one of the factors contributing to the efficiency roll-off. We demonstrate that by using a combination of doped electron transport layer (ETL) and a specially chosen electron blocking layer (EBL) having high hole mobility, this efficiency roll-off can be effectively suppressed. A tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminium (Alq3) based OLED has been fabricated with 2,3,6,7-Tetrahydro-1,1,7,7,-tetramethyl-1H, 5H,11H-10-(2-benzothiazolyl) quinolizino-[9,9a, 1n gh]coumarin (C545T) as the emissive dopant. Bulk doping of the ETL with lithium fluoride (LiF) was optimized to increase the luminous intensity as well as the current efficiency. An EBL with high hole mobility introduced between the EML and the hole transport layer (HTL) improved the performance drastically, and the device brightness at 9 V got improved by a factor of 2.5 compared to that of the control device. While increasing the brightness from 100 cd/m2 to 1000 cd/m2, the power efficiency drop was 47 for the control device whereas only a drop of 15 was observed for the modified device. The possible mechanisms for the enhanced performance are discussed.},

   abstract = {Abstract We present results of steady-state and transient photoluminescence studies of molecularly doped poly(fluorene) films. We study blends with increasing content of the triplet emitter (2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethyl-porphyrinato)PtII (PtOEP) when dispersed in the polymeric poly(fluorene) matrix of the poly[9,9-di-(2-ethylhexyl)-fluorenyl-2,7-diyl] (PF26) derivative. We carry out a unified study of the photophysical reactions that are involved in the energy transfer processes in this system by probing the three luminescence processes of a) PF26 fluorescence, b) triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) induced up-converted PF26 delayed fluorescence and c) PtOEP phosphorescence. With increasing PtOEP content, the process of photon energy recycling in the PF26:PtOEP system is manifested from the quenching of the TTA-induced up-converted PF26 delayed fluorescence and it is rationalized with the use of Forster theory of resonant energy transfer. Based on the combined results of the photophysical and the transmission electron microscopy characterization of the as-spun PF26:PtOEP films, we determine the onset of PtOEP aggregation at 2–3 wt PtOEP content. The analysis of the photophysical data is based on the use of modified Stern–Volmer photokinetic models that are appropriate for the solid state. A static component in the PL quenching of PF26 is revealed for PtOEP contents below 2 wt. The modified Stern–Volmer kinetic scheme further suggests that co-aggregation effects between PF26 and PtOEP are operative with an association constant of ground state complex formation kbind ∼15–17 M−1. The involvement of the ground state heterospecies in the TTA-mediated PF26 up-converted luminescence is discussed. The participation of an electron-exchange step, in the excited state energy transfer pathway between PtOEP and PF26, is proposed for the activation mechanism of the PF26 up-converted fluorescence.},

   abstract = {Realization of efficient deep-blue anthracene-based emitters with superior film-forming and charge transport properties is challenging. A series of non-symmetric 9,10-diphenylanthracenes (DPA) with phenyl and pentyl moieties at the 2nd position and alkyl groups at para positions of the 9,10-phenyls were synthesized and investigated. The non-symmetric substitution at the 2nd position enabled to improve film forming properties as compared to those of the unsubstituted DPA and resulted in glass transition temperatures of up to 92 °C. Small-sized and poorly conjugated substituents allowed to preserve emission in the deep blue range (<450 nm). Substitution at the 2nd position enabled to achieve high fluorescence quantum yields (up to 0.7 in solution, and up to 0.9 in the polymer host), although it caused an up to 10-fold increase in the intersystem crossing rate as compared to that of the unsubstituted DPA. Further optimization of the film forming properties achieved by varying the length of the alkyl groups attached at the 9,10-phenyls enabled to attain very high hole drift mobilities (∼5 × 10−3–1 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) in the solution-processed amorphous films of the DPA compounds.},

The resulting deep-blue emitters (PCzSP, DFASP, and DPASP) exhibit intramolecular charge transfer emissions with remarkably high emission quantum yields. The electroluminescent devices based on these three fluorophores as dopants using CBP as a host exhibit very high device efficiencies; in particular, the DPASP-doped device reveals an extremely high EQE of 12, reaching the limit of a TTA-based device. The EL characteristics of DPASP-doped CBP-based devices at various doping concentrations (0–5) suggest that the dopant DPASP is responsible for the TTA-type delayed fluorescence in the device; no delayed fluorescence was observed for the device using CBP as the host emitter. Moreover, when using DMPPP with ambipolar characteristics as the host, the deep-blue DPASP-doped device also gives outstanding performance with an EQE of nearly 11 with an extremely small efficiency roll-off, which was ascribed to the excellent charge balance in the emitting layer of the EL device. The TTA process of the SP-based dopants accounts significantly for the superior efficiencies of the EL devices.},

   abstract = {Abstract Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) can promise flexible, light weight, energy conservation, and many other advantages for next-generation display and lighting applications. However, achieving efficient blue electroluminescence still remains a challenge. Though both phosphorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials can realize high-efficiency via effective triplet utilization, they need to be doped into appropriate host materials and often suffer from certain degree of efficiency roll-off. Therefore, developing efficient blue-emitting materials suitable for nondoped device with little efficiency roll-off is of great significance in terms of practical applications. Herein, a phenanthroimidazole -- anthracene blue--emitting material is reported that can attain high efficiency at high luminescence in nondoped OLEDs. The maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of nondoped device is 9.44 which is acquired at the luminescence of 1000 cd m−2. The EQE is still as high as 8.09 even the luminescence reaches 10 000 cd m−2. The maximum luminescence is 57 000 cd m−2. The electroluminescence (EL) spectrum shows an emission peak of 470 nm and the Commission International de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates is (0.14, 0.19) at the voltage of 7 V. To the best of the knowledge, this is among the best results of nondoped blue EL devices.},

   abstract = {High-efficiency deep-blue luminophores, especially those satisfying the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) blue standard Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.08), are vital for full-color displays and solid-state illumination. However, deep-blue luminescent materials with efficient photoluminescence quantum yields (φPLs) and high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) over 5 remain very limited. Imidazole has shown great potential in optoelectronic fields owing to its ambipolar nature. Combining imidazole with rigid aromatic rings, such as naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene, could effectively enlarge the π-electronic delocalization, reduce non-radiative transitions of molecules and ensure high φPLs in the solid-state. Herein, two symmetrically twisted pyreno[4,5-d]imidazole-anthracene structural isomers, 9,10-bis(4-(10-phenyl-9H-pyreno[4,5-d]imidazol-9-yl)phenyl)anthracene (N-BPyIA) and 9,10-bis(4-(9-phenyl-9H-pyreno[4,5-d]imidazol-10-yl)phenyl)anthracene (C-BPyIA), have been designed and synthesized by connecting one anthracene group with two pyreno[4,5-d]imidazole groups at the N1 and the C2 position, respectively. They both show high φPLs in neat films (46 for N-BPyIA and 54 for C-BPyIA), good thermal stabilities (Td > 541 °C), and appropriate energy levels for carrier injection. N-BPyIA shows better performance than C-BPyIA when applied in OLEDs. The non-doped device based on N-BPyIA shows sky blue emission with CIE coordinates of (0.22, 0.31), achieving a high EQE of 5.63 with a low efficiency roll-off. In particular, a doped device with better performance is further realized, providing an EQE of 7.67 and deep-blue emission (CIE (0.15, 0.10)), which is very close to the NTSC standard. Such high OLED efficiency may be ascribed to triplet energy harvesting by triplet–triplet annihilation. And to our best knowledge, this is one of the best outcomes of deep-blue imidazole-based fluorescent OLEDs. The results also pave the way for a new type of high-efficiency deep-blue organic luminescent materials regulated by structural isomerization.},

   abstract = {High-performance inverted organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are achieved using solution-processing n-doped 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BPhen) film with cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) as the buffer layer between ZnO and BPhen layer. The n-doped BPhen interlayer shows better electron-transporting properties than undoped BPhen film and reduces the electron-injection barrier from ZnO to BPhen layer. The inverted OLEDs, based on TXO-PhCz emitter incorporating the solution-processed Cs2CO3-doped BPhen film as an interlayer, show a maximum external quantum efficiency of 16.4, current efficiency of 53.9 cd A−1, and power efficiency of 35.6 lm W−1, which realize unprecedentedly high-efficiency TADF-based inverted OLEDs. These results are competitive with the properties of inverted OLEDs based on phosphorescent emitters, implying that TADF emitters have potential to substitute for phosphors on realizing air-stable and large-area displays.},

   abstract = {It has been challenging to find stable blue organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) that rely on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Lack of stable host materials well-fitted to the TADF emitters is one of the critical reasons. The most popular host for blue TADF, bis[2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether oxide (DPEPO), leads to unrealistically high maximum external quantum efficiency. DPEPO is however an unstable material and has a poor charge transporting ability, which in turn induces an intrinsic short OLED operating lifespan. Here, an alternative host material is introduced which educes the potential efficiency and device lifespan of given TADF emitters with the appropriateness of replacing the most popular host material, DPEPO, in developing blue TADF emitters. It simultaneously provides much longer device lifespan and higher external quantum efficiency at a practical brightness due to its high material stability and electron-transport-type character well-fitted for hole-transport-type TADF emitters.},

   abstract = {While significant progress has been made over last few years in the field of organic solid-state lasers, achieving lasing action from organic semiconductors under electrical excitation still remains a big challenge. One of the major barriers towards electrically pumped organic lasers are optical losses due to triplet excitons. In this work, we report both experimental and theoretical results that confirm positive contribution of triplet excitons for the scope of electrically driven organic laser. We studied a model fluorescence material, 9-(9-phenylcarbazole-3-yl)-10(naphthalene-1-yl) anthracene and reveals that the threshold current densities required to achieve lasing emission under electrical injection can be significantly reduced with the aid of triplet-triplet exciton upconversion processes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, to achieve the best performance, the singlet-triplet exciton annihilation must be minimized. These results are unprecedented and provide a pathway towards development of new class of triplet-triplet upconversion materials for injection laser.},

   abstract = {Aromatic organic deep-blue emitters that exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) can harvest all excitons in electrically generated singlets and triplets as light emission. However, blue TADF emitters generally have long exciton lifetimes, leading to severe efficiency decrease, i.e., rolloff, at high current density and luminance by exciton annihilations in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Here, we report a deep-blue TADF emitter employing simple molecular design, in which an activation energy as well as spin–orbit coupling between excited states with different spin multiplicities, were simultaneously controlled. An extremely fast exciton lifetime of 750 ns was realized in a donor–acceptor-type molecular structure without heavy metal elements. An OLED utilizing this TADF emitter displayed deep-blue electroluminescence (EL) with CIE chromaticity coordinates of (0.14, 0.18) and a high maximum EL quantum efficiency of 20.7. Further, the high maximum efficiency were retained to be 20.2 and 17.4 even at high luminance.},
