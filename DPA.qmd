# []{#sec:level3 label="sec:level3"} Confirmation of Triplet-Triplet Upconversion in 2,6-DPA

## Introduction

In this section, I investigated the electroluminescence properties of a
model anthracene derivative 2,6-diphenylanthracene (2,6-DPA)
[@RN39; @RN141] (see @fig-dpa}), as well as 10wt% 2,6-DPA doped as a host in
3,3'-Di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl (mCBP, isomer of CBP) (see @fig-mcbp)
[@RN142; @RN143; @RN144]. The OLED structure can be found in Appendix
[\[apen:oledex\]](#apen:oledex){reference-type="ref"
reference="apen:oledex"}. 2,6-DPA was based in OLEDs in neat and doped
emissive layers, which their performance was analysed under steady state
and nanosecond pulse excitation. The high $wt\%$ of mCBP host doped into
the layer is used to separate the chromophores of 2,6-DPA. Herein, I
found that 2,6-DPA exhibits the TTU mechanism to generate extra singlet
excitons, while the host-guest system fails to exhibit TTU, as expected.
At low-current densities (J) the EQE of the device increases
proportionally to $J$ because of the absence of dominating
singlet-triplet annihilation (STA). At high current densities, STA
becomes a significant loss causing a reduction in EQE and gain.

## Results

The OLED devices that were creates followed the structure, Indium Tin
Oxide (ITO) 100nm /
N,N'-Di(1-naphthyl)-N,N'-diphenyl-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diamine (NPB)
40nm / 2,6-DPA 40nm / 1,3,5-Tris(3-pyridyl-3-phenyl)benzene (TmPyPB)
30nm / Calcium 5nm / Aluminum 100nm (see @fig-dpaenergy). Each layer was
thermally evaporated under high vacuum ($10^-6 mbar)$ without break to
avoid atmosphere exposure. To achieve $10wt\%$ , a simultaneous doping
of mCBP and 2,6-DPA with deposition rates $0.1Å/s$ and $1Å/s$
was required. The deposition rate for the organic layers were between
$0.3 - 0.6Å/s$. Within the device (see @fig-dpaenergy), there is a
substantial hole injection barrier, enabling an accumulation of holes at
the DPA/TmPyPB interface. The thickness and structure was chosen as per
the OLEDs made in Ref. [@39], where they found 40nm DPA layers performed
best. The NPB layer has excellent energy level alignment to facilitate
hole-injection and transport [@RN146]. Calcium is similar to Lithium
Fluoride (LiF) in terms of energy level, so it was used instead a the
buffer layer. Hole-blocking and electron transport layer were decided as
TmPyPB because of the deep HOMO and matching LUMO energy levels. Such a
step-wise energy level diagram enables efficient injection and transport
of charge carriers. The spectra showed a strong blue emission (peak 445
nm), matching the characteristic anthracene blue. The amorphous 2,6-DPA
has a smaller peak at 510 nm.

Measurements of voltage were in increments of 0.2 V and up to 10 V in DC
measurements to observe refined characteristic curves before Joule
heating degrades the device. Four neat film devices were fabricated each
having eight pixels (four $0.75mm^2$ and four $0.3mm^2$). Due to faulty
contacts, thermal evaporation alignment issues, and scratches or
blemishes on the substrate window some pixels become unable to be
tested. Others can degrade whilst a voltage is applied. The J-V-L graph
of four different pixels, as well as their EQE graph, can be found in
Appendix [\[apen:dpaextr\]](#apen:dpaextr){reference-type="ref"
reference="apen:dpaextr"}. A turn-on voltage of $3.1\pm0.1$ V was
achieved at the defined $1 cd/m^2$, with the maximum brightness
approaching $4500\pm500 cd/m^2$ at $9\pm0.2$ V. The J-V-L
characteristics of neat-film 2,6-DPA and the EQE versus current density
graph can be found in @fig-dpajvl. A roll up of EQE (peak $0.7\pm0.1$%) until
$~40\pm10 mA/cm^2$ demonstrates early triplet-triplet upconversion gain
(see @fig-dpaege). The
peak EQE of these 2,6-DPA devices, however, do not exceed the
theoretical maximum EQE of $2.1\%$ (calculated using the PLQY of
$41.2\%$ [@RN39]).

The doped 2,6-DPA in 10wt% of mCBP devices were thermally evaporated,
following the structure: Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) 100nm /
1,1-Bis\[(di-4-tolylamino)phenyl\]cyclohexane (TAPC) 35nm / 2,6-DPA/mCBP
(10wt%) 40nm /
2,2',2"-(1,3,5-Benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBi)
65nm / Calcium 5nm / Aluminum 100nm (see @fig-mcbpenergy). These doped devices
were meant as a comparison for non-exhibiting TTU devices. Their J-V-L
characteristics (@fig-mcbpkvl) and EQE versus current density (@fig-mcbpeqe) display typical
characteristics of fluorescent OLEDs and no presence of EQE roll up at
low current densities (peak $1.5\pm0.1\%$,$EQE_{max}~2.25$). A turn-on
voltage of $6.0\pm0.3$ V was achieved at the defined $1 cd/m^2$, with
the maximum brightness approaching $4800\pm600 cd/m^2$ at $15\pm0.2$ V.

As mentioned in the introduction, in a current density versus luminance
plot (log-log scale) two regimes will appear with altering slopes. The
non-doped OLED demonstrates a clear regime change with a slope of
$~1.7\pm0.05$ at low current densities, changing into $~0.74\pm0.03$.
The transition current density is roughly $~20\pm10 mA/cm^2$. The slope
is $<2$ due to imperfect TTU and losses, such as STA and other
quenching. An observed slope shift from $>1$ to $<1$ indicates definite
gain of triplet to singlet excitons.

Pulse measurements (transient electroluminescence) will demonstrate the
population dynamics of the excitons even to high current densities. For
the non-doped film, 300 ns pulse widths were used to suppress Joule
heating while maintaining long enough steady-state lifetime to see the
gradual EL increase from TTU. The device area used was $0.7mm^2$ to
reduce geometrical capacitance that minimises RC response distortion.
For doped films, a long pulse width ($1.5\mu s$) was used to extrapolate
the affect STA had on fluorescent materials at high current densities.
Whilst DC measurements only reached current densities of $1 A/cm^2$,
pulse measurements reach densities of $>2.5 A/cm^2$. At high current
densities, doped and non-doped devices show a sharp rise, characteristic
of space charge limited current conditions), with the initial rise
lifetime of $~30 ns$. Non-doped devices at a lower current density sees
a longer initial rise ($100ns$ at $10 V$) followed by a gradual increase
as time progresses. This is characteristic of TTU devices because of the
recycling nature of the triplet excitons generating additional singlets.
At high current densities (40 V) the steady state shows a slight
decrease, indicating STA has dominated rate over the TTU generation
rate. How STA affects the steady state in non-TTU devices can be seen in
doped-devices (see @fig-mcbppulse}) -- a noticeable decrease in EL as time progresses.
There is a $~12\%$ difference between the steady states at higher and
lower current densities. At lower current densities, STA is not
prevalent so a steady state is visible. STA dominates via FRET, a
process that is determined by the spectral overlap between $S_1$
emission aand $T_1\rightarrow T_n$ absorption bands.

The turn off electroluminescence of pulse measurements also provide
useful information. For TTU devices, a prompt decay is expected after
voltage turn off due to the loss of direct singlet generation, followed
by a delayed fluorescence (DF) bimolecular decay function
$$EL_{DF} = \frac{1}{(a+bt)^2}$$ where $a$ and $b$ are constants.
Trapped carriers recombining will cause a delayed fluorescence component
with slope between close to 1 [@RN147; @RN148], as we see in @fig-mcbpfit.

## Discussion

2,6-DPA is an anthracene derivative with low PLQY and moderate charge
mobility in amorphous state. In neat film OLEDs, 2,6-DPA shows
distinctive TTU properties such as distinctive regimes in the J-L
log-log plot, with a TTU threshold of $~20\pm10 mA/cm^2$. Not only does
it exhibit steady state increase at low current densities, showing a
$40\%$ rise over $~300ns$ pulse width, but it also exhibits a delayed
fluorescence component following the triplet-triplet upconversion DF
trend. The TTU process in neat films can be seen in @fig-ttadpa.
This 2,6-DPA neat film was compared to the doped film 2,6-DPA in
$10wt\%$ mCBP, which was created to separate the chromophores of 2,6-DPA
to extend the triplet states beyond the short-range Dexter energy
transfer process. This was successful as the doped OLED showed trends of
typical fluorescence. Despite the peak EQE not surpassing the
theoretical maximum of typical fluorescent emitters -- a feat that would
confirm extra exciton generation -- the evidence presented here is
enough to show 2,6-DPA shows promise for enhancing a host-guest system
with TTU. To increase device performance, optimisation of fabrication
process and device structure needs to be considered specific to an
amorphous 2,6-DPA film.
