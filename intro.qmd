Lasers have left an indelible mark on technology, from applications
ranging from medicine to telecommunications to spectroscopy [@RN2], to
everyday applications such as printers, supermarket scanners, and now
even laser televisions [@RN1; @RN7]. What makes organic lasers of
special interest is not only the ability to easily alter their chemical
structure to obtain desired features -- such as tunability through the
visible spectrum -- but also that they kept the benefits of their
organic siblings: organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)
[@RN1; @RN3; @RN4; @RN5; @RN6; @RN8]. The rapid and extensive
development of organic semiconductors (OLEDs did the heavy lifting) gave
the proverbial shoulders for organic lasers to stand on. However,
despite the sturdy and broad shoulders of the OLED industry, the
realisation of *organic laser diodes* remains elusive.

An organic semiconductor laser diode (OSLD) is a device pumped
(injected) with a current rather than pumped optically (with an external
light source) -- in the same way inorganic semiconductor lasers work
[@RN4]. OSLDs in particular have received a favourable gaze from
researches because of their low cost, tunable wavelength from visible to
the infrared region, and their ability to be mounted on flexible
substrates as part of an optical circuit [@RN9]. Achieving an OSLD would
reduce the need for an external pumping device, reduce costs, and open
new applications in bioanalytics and spectroscopy [@RN81]. However,
achieving efficient OSLDs have proved to be a quite significant
challenge [@RN10; @RN11; @RN12; @RN13; @RN14]; yet a 2019 paper by A.
Sandanayaka *et al.* shows promising lasing properties using a
conventional OLED under electrical pumping [@RN15]. This development, as
well as more recent OSLD advances
[@RN9; @RN15; @RN16; @RN17; @RN18; @RN19], demonstrates that we are on
the precipice of achieving stable OSLDs despite the major challenges.

These challenges mainly concern but are not limited to the optical
losses from electrical contacts and electrical losses induced by
spin-triplets and polarons at high current densities [@RN15; @RN20].
Both these losses are due to the spin-triplet states typically being
unable to contribute to electrically pumped lasing [@RN18], which means
the current density lasing threshold increases [@RN4; @RN18]. In other
words, a larger current must be injected to overcome this threshold, but
as more current is injected, more spin-triplets are created, which in
turn induce more losses [@RN18]. This negative feedback loop lies at the
core of realising organic semiconductor laser diodes. Fortunately for
us, we can apply the techniques used by OLEDs to turn the spin-triplets
into laser contributing excitons, such that all generated excitons
contribute to lasing. The main three strategies that have been employed
to harness triplets are thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)
[@RN23; @RN24; @RN25], phosphorescence [@RN22], and triplet-triplet
annihilation (TTA) upconversion [@RN26; @RN27; @RN28]. Recently, the
same strategies have been attempted to realise OSLDs, see Refs
[@RN18; @RN30; @RN29; @RN21].

Herein this thesis demonstrates the potential for a highly emissive
lasing material, 3-(2-Benzothiazolyl)-N,N-diethylumbelliferylamine
(Coumarin6), doped into 2,6-diphenylanthracene (2,6-DPA) to achieve
low-lasing thresholds via the triplet-triplet annihilation strategy.
This guest/host system will generate singlets in the 2,6-DPA via
triplet-triplet upconversion and then transfer them to the lasing guest
to hopefully give a higher photoluminescence yield. The thesis will be
structured into two parts: the confirmation of triplet-triplet
annihilation upconversion in a neat film 2,6-DPA and the realisation of
efficient host/guest system using the lasing material coumarin6 for
prospects of lasing. The testing of these organic lasing materials will
be done via simple OLED device architectures. Even though this report
does not consider fabrication of lasers, it will include an in-depth
(although non exhaustive) description of the physics of lasers. Hence,
this thesis will set the foundations of organic semiconductor lasers to,
metaphorically, lay the initial concrete for the 'path to electrically
pumped organic lasers'.

## []{#sec:level2 label="sec:level2"}Organic semiconductors

The best way to introduce organic semiconductor laser diodes is to begin
with how the phrase starts: organic semiconductor. First the basics of
organic semiconductors (OSCs) will be introduced, followed by the
underlying photophysics of organic semiconductors. Then the optical and
electrical properties of OSCs will be elucidated, subsequently followed
by the energy transfer mechanisms. Next is where triplet-triplet
annihilation will be introduced. Naturally, the various losses in
organic semiconductors will be explored next. To tie it into how to test
organic semiconductors, organic light emitting diodes will set the stage
for the rest of the thesis. Finally, organic laser diodes and the
physics of lasers will be included to put this all into context of
lasers.

### General properties of organic semiconductors

Organic compounds contain a covalently bound carbon atom, whose binding
configurations enable more than 19 million different possible organic
compounds each with various properties [@RN81]. It is easy to alter the
organic compound's molecular structure, which is extremely fortunate for
optoelectronic applications since their optical and electrical
properties depend on their structure. In 1976, the discovery of
conducting polymers began the journey of new generation polymers that
had electrical and optical properties of metals or semiconductors, while
retaining the benefits of easily processed polymers [@RN82].

Carbon atoms can bond to each other in single, double, and triple bonds.
Organic compounds that have exclusively single bonds (four bonds per
carbon atom) are unable to conduct electricity due to the binding energy
of a single bond being in the ground state. Hence these molecules (e.g.
polystyrene) cannot be used for electronics apart from cladding of
electric cables.

Molecules that have alternating single and double bonds are called
conjugated molecules. In a conjugated molecule, the carbon atoms form
three strongly bound $\sigma$-bonds and one weakly bound $\pi$-bond. The
skeletal structure of the polymer is formed by the $\sigma$-bonds, with
the delocalized $\pi$-electrons (comprising the $\pi$-bonds) able to
travel along the polymer chain. The $\pi$-electron (binding energy of
$1 eV$) upon excitation can go to the anti-binding $\pi^*$-state, where
the distance between comprises the commonly known band gap. Typically,
for these conjugated molecules, the band gap is around $2.5 eV$. These
conjugated molecules exhibit semiconducting properties because of their
ability to transport charges along the polymer chain.

There are a few classes of organic semiconductors. One class is
$\pi$-conjugated polymers that can be processed from solution by
spin-coating. While this technique is cheap and feasible over large
areas, the ability to create multilayer devices is inhibited by the
failure to dissolve all layers. Light emission from electrical
injection, or electroluminescence, was first observed in 1990 using
conjugated molecules [@RN6]. Similarly, optically pumped lasers were
shown in 1996 [@RN8; @RN32].

Another class is small molecules that have low-molecular weight. These
molecules also have delocalized $\pi$-electrons. This class can be
processed by thermal evaporation under high vacuum. While this technique
requires specialised equipment, the technique benefits from deposition
of multilayer devices of arbitrary combinations. Evaporating multiple
materials simultaneously means the layers can be *doped*. Doping gives
access to altering the band gap characteristics of the main (host)
material, which will change the conductivity, emission, and absorption
properties of the material [@RN3]. Tang *et al.* [@RN35] and Adachi *et
al.* [@RN36] demonstrated how host-dopant systems in OLEDs led to
greater control of emission colour and electroluminescence efficiency
(through the guest) and control over the charge transport and
electron-hole pair formation and transfer (through the host). Small
molecule-semiconductors first saw optically pumped laser operation in
1997 [@RN5]. The other organic semiconductor classes that have seen
successful device fabrication include single crystals (anthracene)
[@RN31], conjugated dendrimers [@RN33], and spiro-compounds [@RN34].
Some common organic molecules, as well as the ones present in this
thesis, have their organic structure shown in @fig-widestruc.

To provide a quick recap, organic conjugated molecules can be excited
electrically and optically by photons in the visible range because of
the low-binding energy of the delocalized $\pi$-electrons along the
polymer chain. These conjugated molecules thus offer semiconducting
properties. The question to propel us forward is: how can these
conjugated molecules emit all of the visible wavelengths of light? Hence
to tackle this, next the optical properties of the conjugated molecules
will be discussed.

## Optical properties of organic semiconductors {#sec-opti}

In the organic semiconducting picture, the electrons of the
$\sigma$-bond can be ignored because they are tightly bound as opposed
to the delocalized $\pi$-electron that can be excited between the
$\pi-\pi^*$ states. The $\pi$-state can be thought of as the ground
state, or the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Its counterpart
is the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) or $\pi^*$-state. It
is worth noting that the band gap is the difference between the electron
affinity (EA) of the layer and the ionization potential (IP), and it is
often smaller than the difference between LUMO and HOMO (see @fig-homo) [@RN5]. The
molecules in Figure
@fig-widestruc have their HOMO/LUMO as well as other
properties are shown in Table [1.1](#tab:molecules){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:molecules"}.

A photon can be incident upon the molecule to excite the $\pi$-electron
to form an electron-hole pair. This delocalized charge pair is called an
exciton. Excitons are stable at room temperature because of their large
binding energy ($1 eV$) compared to its thermal activation energy
($k_BT=25 meV$) [@RN81]. It is then easier to interpret the optical (and
electrical) properties in this exciton picture. Excitons have many
excitonic states, but the lowest is the ground state $S_0$. Each
excitonic state has many sub-states that offshoot energetically due to
vibrational fluctuations (see @fig-absorb). The bandgap
separates the ground state $S_0$ and the first excited state $S_1$. A
photon can excite the exciton from the ground state to a higher vibronic
state of a singlet state, and then subsequently relax to the lowest
vibronic state in 1 ps timescale. Then the lowest vibronic state of the
$S_1$ can decay either radiatively (emitting light) or nonradiatively to
the groundstate with a lifetime of 1 ns. Because the absorption normally
transitions to a higher vibronic state and then relax to a lower
vibronic state, the emission spectra tends to be redshifted (lower
energy) compared to the absorption spectra. This energy difference
between the spectra is referred to as Stokes shift [@RN4; @RN81]. Lasers
benefit from Stokes shift because it helps reduce self absorption
losses.

![Basic transitions within an organic molecule between the ground state $S_0$ and the excited singlet $S_1$, $S_2$,... $S_n$ and triplet states $T_1$, $T_2$,... $T_n$, represented in a Jablonski diagram](images/absorb.pdf){#fig-absorb}

Excitons, after they absorb a photon, transition to the singlet state.
Singlet states can undergo fluorescent decay (emission of light) or
undergo intersystem crossing (ISC) into the triplet state. In typical
fluorescent devices, the lifetime of fluorescent decay is much shorter
than ISC. ISC becomes enhanced in phosphorescent materials because of
their strong spin-orbit coupling. The triplet state $T_1$ has long
lifetimes of $\mu s$-$ms$, which have subsequent pathways that include
phosphorescent decay or reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). These
pathways are shown in @fig-absorb. Triplet deactivation are dominated by nonradiative
decay at room temperature, hence why triplets are usually called
non-emissive states. Phosphorescent decay can be increased by using
heavy metal atoms with strong spin-orbit coupling.

Opposed to a radiative decay (fluorescence) with a decay rate $k_r$, a
molecule can decay nonradiatively to the groundstate by internal
conversion (IC). It has a decay rate $k_{nr}=\tau_{nr}^{-1}$. To avoid
nonradiative decay (NRD), a rigid and planar molecular structure can be
introduced to not have the vibrational coupling of $S_1$ and $S_0$
states, i.e. the $S_1$ will not vibrationally transfer its energy to
$S_0$. Small band gap (long-wavelengths) molecules will suffer from
vibrational coupling -- the effect is labeled the energy gap law.

## Electrical properties of organic semiconductors

This section will be more detailed than the optical @sec-opti because this
report mainly focuses on electrically pumped laser diodes and OLEDs.
First the basics will be discussed, followed by charge carriers and
their process from injection to transportation.

#### Charge carriers

Electrons and holes within an organic semiconductor interact stronger
with the fixed atoms than in inorganic materials [@RN81]. This stronger
interaction causes a new consideration for holes and electrons -- a
quasiparticle called a polaron [@RN4]. The lower polaronic state is
occupied by a single charge, while the upper polaronic state is occupied
with two charges. The LUMO level fills the lower polaronic state with
positive polarons (holes) and the HOMO level fills the higher polaronic
state with negative polarons (electrons). The polaronic stated cause
additional absorption bands, resulting in a new type of loss: polaron
induced absorption.

#### Charge Transport

Charge carriers in conjugated polymers are localized to a portion of the
polymer chain, usually called the active unit or chromophore, because of
the lack of long-range translational symmetry [@RN43; @RN81]. Thus the
only way for charges to transfer between neighbouring molecules is via
phonon assisted tunnelling, or a stochastic hopping process. The
mobility of this hopping in organic semiconductors is between
$10^{-8} cm/Vs$ to $10^{-3} cm^2/Vs$. Because hopping is highly
inefficient, it explains the very low carrier mobilities in organic
semiconductors, contrasted to their inorganic counterparts [@RN4]. The
charge transport of an organic material is given by its electric
conductivity $\sigma$ that depends on the density of the charge carriers
$n$, and the charger carrier mobility $\mu$, given by
$$\sigma = \mu n q$$where $q$ is the elementary electron charge [@RN4].
We can see from this relation that in order to achieve high electrical
conductivity, and thus a high charge transport, the charge carrier
mobility must be high. Further information on charge transport in
organic semiconductors can be found in Refs. [@RN43; @RN44; @RN45].

#### Electron-hole recombination

Similar to optical properties, because the exciton is stable at room
tempetature, it is best to consider the the charge carrier pair in the
exciton picture. In organic semiconductors, recombining electrons and
holes generate excitons. Light emission is thus the radiative decay of
these excitons. The recombination is governed by Langevin theory
[@RN83], such that we get the exciton formation formula
$$e + h \rightarrow
\begin{cases}
    1/4,& S_n^*\rightarrow S_1\\
    3/4,& T_n^*\rightarrow T_1
\end{cases}$$ where $S_n$ and $T_n$ are the higher-lying singlet and
triplet states respectively [@RN81]. Their lifetime is about 1 ps
because of their ultra fast relaxation to the lowest excited state $S_1$
or $T_1$. Spin statistics [@RN9] govern the 3:1 generation ratio of
triplets to singlet excitons, which has been experimentally determined
[@RN84]. It is also important to note that these probabilities occur
only when the singlet--triplet gap is much less than $k_BT$. Most
practical molecules are within this bound at room temperature; however,
if the singlet--triplet gap is much larger than $k_BT$, triplets form
with nearly $100\%$ probability [@RN65]. In other words, excitons decay
to the ground state via the lowest triplet state if the singlet--triplet
energy gap is larger than $k_BT$.

The recombination of holes and electrons have a rate that is given by
$$\gamma = \frac{e(\mu_e+\mu_h)n_e(x,t)n_h(x,t)}{\epsilon_r\epsilon_0}$$
where recombination $\gamma$ is a function of the charge carrier
mobilities $\mu_e$ and $\mu_h$, and the electron density $n_e(x,t)$ and
hole density $n_h(x,t)$. From this, high exciton generation needs high
mobility materials as well as higher particle densities. Hole mobility
is typically one order of magnitude larger than the electron mobility --
such a difference means the recombination $\gamma$ mainly depends on the
higher mobility.

#### Charge carrier injection

To pass a current (charges) through an organic semiconductor it has to
be sandwiched between an anode and cathode. The entire structure is
called an organic semiconductor light emitting diode (OLED). Once a
voltage is applied across the electrodes, the electrons and holes
diffuse through the layers. While OLEDs usually have a current density
of a few $mA/cm^2$, laser diodes require much higher current densities.
The electrons are injected into the LUMO and the holes into the HOMO to
form an exciton. OLEDs will be discussed further in @sec-OLED.

### Energy Transfer

Excitons play a pivotal role into how the organic molecule emits light
but their dynamics are not as simple as stationary particles. They can
have their energy transferred across several nanometers, which enables
movement between identical molecules and between a host/guest system.
These energy transfers can enable unique energy pathways to increase the
total light emission. The two main transfers in organic semiconductors
will be discussed next.

#### Förster resonance energy transfer

Förster (sometimes called fluorescent) resonance energy transfer (FRET)
is a resonant energy transfer process between two singlet exciton states
of two molecules. It is a resonant process because the excited donor
molecule ($D^*$) decays without emission of a photon, and then transfers
the energy to an accepting molecule (A) (see @fig-FRET). FRET is
goverend by Fermi's golden rule for transfer between states, which means
they have a transfer rate $\Gamma_{DA}$ from a donor (D) to acceptor (A)
is $$\Gamma_{DA} = 4\pi^2|V_{DA}|^2]\delta(E_A-E_M)$$ where $V_{DA}$ is
the matrix element for interaction of the donor and acceptor, who have
energies $E_D$ and $E_A$ respectively [@RN81]. The $\delta$-function
describes the need for the energies to match, or at least have spectral
overlap of the absorption and emission spectrum. Even though the energy
transfer occurs without the emission of a photon, we tend to say that
typically the spectrum of the donor $g_A(E)$ overlaps with the
*absorption* spectrum of the acceptor $g_D(E)$. The long-range
dipole-dopole interactions between D and A cause the pairing of spectrum
overlap. This coupling influences the rate of energy transfer, as well
as the quantum yield of the donor, the relative orientation of D and A
transition dipoles, and the distance between the molecules. Integrating
over the spectral overlap and evaluating the interaction matrix elements
provides the Förster formula which provides the total transfer rate
$k_{DA}$
$$k_{DA} = 8.8\times10^{17} \frac{\kappa^2}{n^4\tau_Dr^6}\int g_A(E)g_D(E)dE$$
which then can be written as
$$k_{DA}(r) = \frac{1}{\tau_D}\left(\frac{R_0}{r}\right)^6$$ where
$\tau_D$ is the decay time of the donor in the absence of the acceptor,
$\kappa$ is the relative orientation of the dipoles, $R_0$ is the
Förster distance (typically a few nanometers [@RN79]), and $r$ is the
D-to-A distance. Clearly, FRET is an extremely distance dependent
process ($k_{FRET}\propto r^{-6}$). FRET usually occurs at distances of
20 to 90 Å, typical distances of proteins or membrane thickness [@RN79].
The transitions must be allowed, so that is why this process only works
for singlet excitons.

FRET is mainly seen in a host/guest system, where in order to get
singlets from the host to guest, we utilise FRET to transfer singlets on
the host to the guest. FRET governs some of the bimolecular annihilation
processes that are important in organic semiconductors. The key takeaway
from this information is that this process is distance dependent, with a
$50\%$ efficiency at $r=R_0$ calculated from the efficiency $\rho$ of
the energy transfer [@RN4]
$$\rho = \frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{r}{R_0}\right)^6}$$

![Förster resonance energy transfer is a dipole-dipole interaction, where in the absence of a photon, the Donor D releases energy that is reabsorbed by the acceptor A. The must be overlap between emission spectrum and absorption spectrum for the transfer to happen. Dexter energy transfer has simultaneous exchange of electrons and holes, such that an exciton is transferred between D and A. Singlets are displayed here, but Dexter energy transfer does work for triplets too.](images/FRET.pdf){#fig-FRET}

#### Dexter energy transfer

DET is one of the mechanisms of short-range quenching, and like the name
suggest the molecules need to be close. So close in fact that the D
molecule and quencher Q must have their electronic clouds overlap. DET
describes an exchange of electrons from the LUMO of the donor to the
LUMO of the acceptor. Similarly the hole is transferred the other way in
the HOMO. Such that the net transfer in a host/guest system is an
exciton moving between the D and A [@RN85]. The difference between DET
and Fret can be found in in @fig-FRET. The rate of DET $k_{DET}$ is
$$k_{DET} = \hbar P^2Je^\frac{-2r}{L}$$ 
where r is distance between D and A, $J$ is the spectral overlap, and the other variables, P and L, are
constants that are hard to quantify [@RN85]. DET occurs only across
distances between $0.5$-$2$ nm, compared to the $2$-$10$ nm of FRET.

## Losses in organic semiconductors

The current densities needed to achieve organic laser diodes are
estimated to be at least $1 kA/cm^2$ [@RN9]. In organic semiconductors,
to obtain this threshold means that the particle densities must be
around $10^{19}/cm^3$ and electric fields of up to $10^7 V/cm$ are
needed -- this is considering the low mobilities of organic
semiconductors $10^{-8}-10^{-3}cm^2/Vs$ [@RN81]. Thus the populations of
excitons will need to be extremely high -- a perfect environment for
increased bimolecular annihilation processes. Here, a description of
these process will be described.

Bimolecular annihilation processes occur between particles within the
organic semiconductor, such as charge carriers and excitons. Most of
these processes quench the emissive singlet excitons (see @fig-biomoc). Hence,
these processes are important to realising efficient light emission. The
diagram indicates the particle species by the circles, and which
population they are quenching by the direction of the arrows. 
[Table 1.2](#tab:bimoc){reference-type="ref" reference="tab:bimoc"} shows the
processes in terms of donor (D) and acceptor (A).

![The bimolecular annihilation process are displayed in relation to singlets <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub>1</sub></span>, triplets <span class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub>1</sub></span>, and polarons e and h.

#### Singlet-singlet annihilation (SSA)

The emissive excited state donor $D^*$ moloecule can be quenched by the
identical molecule, which when represented in the singlet-singlet
process ($D^*=S_1$) is $$S_1 + S_1 \rightarrow S_n + S_0$$ where $S_1$
is the excited singlet state and $S_0$ is the ground state
[@RN87; @RN88]. One molecule falls to the ground state, the other gets
excited to a higher singlet state $S_n$ that has a chance to decay
either to the singlet state or the triplet state. The rate of SSA
$k_{SSA}$ in terms of the $S_1$ population is given by
$$\frac{dS_1}{dt} = -(2-\zeta)k_{SSA}S_1^2$$ where $\zeta$ factor is
because not all excited states $S_n$ are returned to the $S_1$ state.
The spin conservation is governed by spin statistics [@RN84], usually
$\zeta=0.25$ [@RN87]. $k_{ss}$ is usually on the order of
$10^{-9} cm^3/s$. To measure this rate constant $k_{SSA}$ transient
photoluminescence measurements can be done [@RN89], which involves a
pulse measurement to a width less than the lifetime of radiative singlet
decay. Naturally, when the population of singlets are low, the rate of
SSA becomes negligible.

#### Exciton-polaron annihilation

Both singlet-polaron annihilation (SPA) and triplet-polaron annihilation
occur under electrical injection because of the high lifetimes of
polarons. The basic concept is the excitons transfer their energy by
deactivation to the polaron via the process
$$S_1 / T_1 + (e,h) \rightarrow S_0 + (e,h)$$ where the rate of
$k_{SPA}$ can be different for hole or electron quenching. At low
current densities, SPA is negligible, but starts becoming a serious
issue the more current injected.

#### Singlet-Triplet Annihilation

If the $S_1$ and the $T_1$ state share overlap, the singlet and triplets
can interact causing an excitation to a higher triplet state $T_n$ and a
nonradiative decay to the ground state. The process is
$$S_1 + T_1 \rightarrow S_0 + T_n$$ For non-TADF materials, where
reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) is unlikely, the excited state $T_n$
will relax back to the long-lived $T_1$ and then subsequently
non-radiatively decay back the ground state. The rate equation for STA
is $$\frac{dS_1}{dt} = -k_{STA}S_1T_1$$ where $k_{STA}$ is usually on
the order of $10^{-9} cm^3/s$. This process is a FRET type transfer, and
especially dominate in conjugated polymers[@RN80] because the triplets
accumulate in the device due to their long lifetimes.

#### Intersystem Crossing (ISC)

For every excited singlet state, a triplet state lies lower in energy by
an amount $\Delta E_{ST}$ that is often referred to as the
singlet-triplet splitting. While not pertinent to understand why this is
the case, the extremely simplified explanation is that Pauli exclusion
principle forces the spatial factor of the singlet wave function to be
symmetric and anti-symmetric for the triplet wave function. This
symmetry/antisymmetry causes the mean potential energy of the electrons
to be higher for singlets than triplets with the same quantum numbers n
and m. To read more in detail see Ref. [@RN75]. This relationships means
we get overlap with the wave functions that scales exponentially with
$\Delta E_{ST}$. Thus a nearly spontaneous transfer from the $S_1$
population to the lower $T_1$ state becomes possible, which is called
intersystem crossing (ISC). The pathway can be seen in @fig-ISC. The ISC rate
equation $k_{ISC}$ can be formed: $$\frac{dT_1}{dt} = k_{ISC}S_1$$
Fluourscent emitters have ISC rates on the order of hundreds of
nanoseconds ($k_{ISC} ~ 10^7s^{-1}$ [@RN4], with a timescale of
$\tau_{ISC} = 1/k_{ISC}$. This rate depends strongly on the spin-orbit
coupling, as well as the vibrational overlap of the wavefunctions
[@RN75].Reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) is the same process in
reverse, but it is usually only seen in thermally activated delayed
fluorescent materials where the $E_{ST}$ is small.

#### Triplet-Triplet Annihilation (TTA)

Organic semiconductors under electrical excitation generate triplets at
a $75\%$ chance to $25\%$ singlets. This means that in these molecules
triplet-triplet annihilation plays a major role in the triplet dynamics,
especially because triplets are long-lived. The two triplet excitons
interact (annihilate) causing a transfer of energy from the first
exciton to the second. The excited exciton goes to a higher lying state,
which then relaxes so a singlet, triplet, or quintlet state. Although
this bimolecular process can be considered a loss, it can also lead to
gain via the generation of singlets out of triplets. Hence the focal
point of this thesis is \"Can TTA be utilised to manage the triplet
states to increase the efficiency of emission such that organic laser
diodes can be realised?\". Triplet-triplet annihilation will be
discussed in further in Section
[1.5.0.3](#sec:type){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:type"}.

#### Induced absorption

Photons incident upon the conjugated molecule can be quenched by
polarons and triplets because of the additional absorption bands. The
triplets and polarons care excited to a higher lying state and then
relax back to the original position. These losses only substantially
affect laser diodes, so it will not be discussed any further. For more
information, see Ref. [@RN90] for triplet absorption (TA) and Ref.
[@RN91] for polaron absorption (PA).

## Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) {#sec-OLED}

This thesis has the goal of achieving organic laser diodes; but in order
to get there, OLEDs are the more cost efficient and easier method of
analysing the emissive layer. This thesis first aims to determine the
triplet-triplet annihilation property of an emissive layer, followed up
by analysing the success of doping a TTA-exhibiting host with a
efficient lasing guest. To do this, fabrication of OLEDs will be able to
test the electrical characteristics and performances of these materials.

#### Device structure

To pass a current through an organic semiconductor, it has to be
sandwiched between an anode and cathode, where we call the entire
structure an OLED device. Once a voltage is applied across the
electrodes, the electrons and holes diffuse through the layers. The
exciton forms on the host, but if a dopant is present within the
emissive layer, the exciton transfers to the guest via either Förster
resonance energy transfer or by Dexter energy transfer [@RN3; @RN4]. To
avoid non-radiative losses (via heat), as shown in @fig-homo the host IP
is usually larger than the guest HOMO. This enables a minimal barrier
for the transferring electron to overcome. Similarly, the cathodes --
typically indium tin oxide (ITO) as the anode and aluminium doped with
calcium as the cathode -- operate better if their work function align
with the IP and EA of the organic layers. Matching the energy levels of
each layer within an OLED is crucial to efficient device performance.
Discussion of the energy levels concerned with this report's devices can
be found in their relevant section.\

Figure (a) is an example of a simple OLED device with its energy
level diagram (b). Holes are injected from the anode into the hole
transport layer (HTL) such that the holes then have an easier time
entering the emissive layer. Similar to the anode, electrons enter from the cathode into the electron transport layer (ETL). Electrons and holes recombine in the light emitting layer (EML), forming an exciton that has four possible permutations: three triplet states each with a total spin of 1, and one singlet state with a total spin of zero. 
:::


Modern day OLED architectures consist of as many as five or more organic
layers (see @fig-wideA), where each layer helps improve the luminescence
efficiency, reduce operational voltage, and improve operational
stability [@RN3; @RN5; @RN49]. The purpose of these layers were to give
fine control over the charge injection, charge transport, electron-hole
pair (exciton) diffusion, and photon emission. These improvements led to
OLED devices reaching the threshold efficiencies, and some now consider
them better than inorganic LEDs.

#### Performance characteristics

It is extremely useful to define the efficiency of emitted fluorescence
photons versus the number of inputted photons or polarons (depending on
photoluminescence or electroluminescence). Such a ratio, called the
photo/electroluminescence quantum yield $\phi_F(0<\phi_F<1)$, enables
meaningful discussion about the efficiency of the device and where the
losses come from. It is defined as
$$\phi_F = \frac{k_r}{k_r+k_{nr}+k_{ISC}}=\frac{\tau_nr}{\tau_{rad}+\tau_{nr}+\tau_{ISC}}=\frac{\tau_F}{\tau_{rad}}$$
where $\tau_F$ is the fluorescence lifetime [@RN4], a measure of the
singlet state's effective lifetime. The total decay rate $k$ is the sum
of the radiative decay $k_r$ and nonradiative decay $k_{nr}$. The total
decay rate follows an exponential function, which can be fitted to the
time resolved luminescence to estimate the value via
$$I(t) = I_0e^{-kt}$$ where $I_0$ and I(t) is the initial and time
response luminescence intensities, respectively. The total efficiency of
a device is more than just the fluorescence quantum yield. This external
quantum efficiency (EQE) is the total performance efficiency of the
device that is given by
$$\phi_{EQE} = \gamma \phi_{spin}\phi_F\eta_{out}$$ where $\gamma$ is a
factor describing how often charges recombine in the emissive layer
(usually $\gamma \approx 1$), $\phi_{spin}$ is the singlet-triplet spin
probability factor (in fluorescence $\phi_{spin} ~ 0.25$), and
$\eta_{out}$ is a factor describing the percentage of light escaping the
device (usually $\phi_{out} ~ 20-25\%$). $\gamma$ and $\eta_{out}$ are
altered via the device architecture, while $\phi_F$ and $\phi_{spin}$
are altered via the emissive layer. To put it into context for this
report, one focus is to choose the right emissive layer to obtain high
$\phi_F$ and $\phi_{spin}$ and by proxy a high EQE. In this thesis,
$\phi_{spin}$ will be increased by utilising TTA, the process that
generates extra singlet excitons from the triplets. $\phi_F$ is low for
TTA materials, so hence why it will be doped with a more efficient
lasing material.

OLEDs also need to consider operational lifetime, a key attribute that
is directly proportional to the degradation of the devices due to losses
such as localized heating, material decomposition, and Coulombic
degradation [@RN50; @RN51; @RN52; @RN53; @RN54; @RN55]. If the luminance
efficiency is increased and thus reduces the current needed to achieve a
target brightness, the operational lifetime is increased. This is why it
is so important to try and reduce the current input, especially for
electrically pumped lasers. A typical OLED display operates at around
$0.01 A cm^{-2}$; a typical inorganic semiconductor laser diode operates
at a current density of $1000 A cm^{-2}$ [@RN1]. Hence decreasing the
current-density threshold by making the device more efficient is
necessary to achieving lasing. This is part of the motivation for this
thesis.

#### Types of emissive layers {#sec-type}

Any light emitted from electrical injected we label as
electroluminescence (photoluminescence for optically pumped). To compare
all the different ways emissive layers electroluminesce, the layers are
labelled depending on their emission pathway. Light emission via singlet
exciton decay is labelled as fluorescence. Because fluorescent materials
can only emit photons from the singlet excited state [@RN3; @RN4; @RN9],
their internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is limited to $25\%$. We do not
see emission from the triplet excites states because the nonradiative
decay out-competes radiative decay at room temperature [@RN9]. At low
temperatures, triplet-state emission is possible, but is impractical. Up
until 1997, most light emitting devices used fluorescent materials.

Organic phosphorescent dopants were discovered to be able to emit
photons from the decay of triplet excited states due to strong
spin-orbit coupling, which led to high IQEs. They also have fast rates
of singlet-triplet intersystem crossing (ISC). This meant that these
phosphorescent materials could be used as a guest to extract the
triplets and singlet excited states via Dexter energy transfer from the
host. IQEs of up to $100\%$ were achievable [@RN47; @RN48].
Phosphorescent materials struggle at achieving operational stability
compared to fluorescent materials, especially in the blue emission
regime [@RN67].

Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters offer an
alternative way to harness the triplets than phosphorescent materials.
In TADF materials, the splitting $\Delta E_{ST}$ between the singlet and
triplet excited-states enables the triplet exciton to transfer to the
singlet state via an efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC)
process. The process needs thermal energy to transfer between energy
states; so typical TADF materials have a splitting of less than $0.5 eV$
such that the thermal energy from room temperature suffices. Thus in a
TADF emitter, the initial singlet excitons decay radiatively with a
prompt emission (nanosecond timescale), which is then followed by a
delayed emission from the triplet-to-singlet RISC decay (microsecond to
millisecond timescale).

@fig-emitters compares the emission mechanism in
fluorescent, phosphorescent, and TADF emitters in a Jablonski diagram.
Understanding these dynamics of exciton population and emission pathways
is crucial to obtaining an efficient device. In terms of organic lasing,
the long decay lifetimes of triplet states are the biggest disadvantage
for phosphorescence, along with its scarcity and expensiveness of its
materials. The TADF pathway has slow reverse intersystem crossing, which
means that any realisation of lasing through this pathway will be
unstable because of the slow singlet formation. On the other hand,
fluorescent emitters have short excited-state lifetimes as well as
comparatively higher radiative rates. The issue of course with
fluorescent emitters is their IQE of $25\%$.

#### Triplet-triplet Upconversion

This now enables the introduction of the pathway considered in this
thesis: triplet-triplet upconversion (TTU). Similar to TADF materials,
this pathway has a prompt component and a delayed component. The prompt
emission comes from the direct singlet exciton, while the delayed
emission comes after two triplets annihilate together (via
triplet-triplet annihilation, TTA) and produce a singlet that then
radiatively decays. Triplet-triplet upconversion-based OLEDs have
realised external quantum efficiencies of $10\%$ as opposed to the
theoretical limit of fluorescence-based OLEDs of $5\%$.

![The life of an exciton from formation (charge recombination) to decay via different pathways. Triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) with rate constant <span class="math inline"><em>γ</em><sub><em>T</em><em>T</em><em>A</em></sub></span> involves one triplet non-radiatively decaying to the ground state, and the other being promoted to an intermediate state. The intermediate state then generates 1/4 singlets and 3/4 triplets, with the  Triplets being able to be recycled.](images/TTUTTA.pdf){#fig-TTUTTA}


Triplet-triplet annihilation has two colliding triplet states leading to
an intermediate state with twice the energy of the $T_1$ state. The
intermediate states can then lead to one singlet state, three triplet
states, and five quintet states [@RN107]. This quintet state can be
formed due to conservation of total spin angular momentum, but typically
has much higher energy than the two triplet states at room temperature
[@RN106; @RN83; @RN27]; so the pathways for the intermediate state are
the higher-lying triplet $T_n$ state or to a singlet state $S_1$ (see
Appendix [\[apen:A\]](#apen:A){reference-type="ref"
reference="apen:A"}). Writing it mathematically, the pathways are
[@RN107; @RN27; @RN83] $$\label{eq:1} 
    T_1 + T_1 \rightarrow T_n + S_0 \rightarrow T_1+S_0$$ or
$$\label{eq:2}
    T_1 + T_1 \rightarrow S_1 + S_0$$ The generated triplets from the
triplet pathway can be recycled back into further TTA. So assuming no
other decay channels for triplets, the maximum fraction of singlets
$f_{singlets}$ from this series of TTA is
$$f_{singlets} = \frac{f}{2} \sum_{n=0}^{n=\infty} \left(\frac{1-f}{2} \right)^n = f\frac{1-f}{1+f}$$
where $f$ is the fraction of $S_1$ singlets being formed from one TTA
event [@RN107]. If $f=25\%$, $f_{singlets}=15\%$. In some new anthracene
derivatives, two triplet states have less energy than the higher lying
$T_n$ state. This means the triplet pathway is unreachable and only the
singlet pathway can be accessed. In this scenario, $f=50$, so the
maximum singlet generation can be
$S_{25\%}+(T_{75\%}\times TTA_{50\%} = 62.5\%$. This leads to a maximum
EQE of $12.5\%$, but this pathway is restricted to a few materials
[@RN108].

The rate constant of TTA $\gamma_{TTA}$ can be paired with $f$ to create
the rate constants of each pathway $f\gamma_{TTA}$ and
$(1-f)\gamma{TTA}$. To develop full singlet and triplet density
dynamics, singlet-triplet annihilation (STA) needs to be included in our
model [@RN27]. STA has the pathway [@RN83] $$\label{eq:3} 
    T + S \rightarrow T + S_0$$ with the rate constant $k_{ST}$. The
full dynamics are therefore
$$\frac{dS}{dt} = \gamma(J) \frac{J}{4ed} - (k_s+k_{s.nr}+k_{ISC}S - k_{ST}ST + f\gamma_{TTA}T^2$$
and
$$\frac{dT}{dt} = \gamma(J) \frac{3J}{4ed} - k_{T,nr}T - k_{ISC}S - (1-f)\gamma_{TTA}T^2$$
where TTU has a rate $\gamma_{TTU}=f\gamma_{TTA}T^2$ (process
([\[eq:1\]](#eq:1){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:1"})), process
([\[eq:2\]](#eq:2){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:2"}) has a rate of
$(1-f)\gamma_{TTA}T^2$, process ([\[eq:3\]](#eq:3){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:3"}) has a rate $k_{ST}ST$, $\gamma(J)$ is the charge
balance factor [@RN109; @RN110], $e$ is the electron charge, $d$ is the
emissive layer thickness, and $k_s$ and $k_T$ are the singlet and
triplet natural decay rates. These dynamic equations can be solved in
two limiting stead-state conditions [@RN107; @RN111; @RN112]. TTA is
distance-dependent between the neighbouring triplets in solid films,
such that at low current density when minimal triplet exciton population
the mini-triplet decay dominates over the bimolecular triplet
annihilation ($k{T,nr}T\gg \gamma_{TTU}T^2$). Setting
$\gamma(J)\frac{J}{4edk_{T,nr}} \equiv T_{G}$, the triplet population is
$T = \frac{T_G}{k_{T,nr}}$ such that the singlet population from TTU in
a neat film is $$S = \frac{\gamma_{TTU}}{k_{T,nr}+k_S}T^2$$ such that
the luminance L is proportional to current density by $$L \propto J^2$$
In steady state, the EQE can be calculated via
$EQE(J) = \eta_{out}\phi_{F} \frac{k_sS(J)}{J/(ed)}$, such that at low
current density the EQE is proportional to current density by
$$EQE \propto J$$

At increasing current density, the triplet excitons become abundant and
the bimolecular process dominates the dynamics
($k{T,nr}T\ll \gamma_{TTU}T^2$). In this regime, the $L\propto J$ and
the EQE becomes insensitive to current, meaning the usual EQE roll-off
would occur. The quadratic dependence on J at low current densities
transitions to the a linear dependence above the critical triplet
density $T{transition}\>(k_{TTU}\tau)^-1$ [@RN113] (see @fig-loglogTTU)

### Measurement of OLED performance

To analyse OLEDs performance, such as efficiency, there are numerous
performance characteristics that can be assessed. To record measurements
for an OLED, we can apply a voltage in direct current (DC) operation or
alternating current (AC) via a pulse. The main measurement variables are
voltage (V), current density ($mA/cm^2$), and luminance/brightness
($cd/m^2$), with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) needing to be
calculated from these measurements.

#### DC measurements

In DC measurements, typically measurements of the main three variables
are done over a range of voltages to construct a current
density-voltage-luminance, or J-V-L, graph. In training, I created an
OLED with Super Yellow, poly(phenylenevinylene), as the emissive layer.
Its J-V-L graph shows the natural increase in current density as voltage
is increased -- luminance follows suit too. For the external quantum
efficiency, there usually is a peak EQE for a certain current density.
This is after current density is able to produce sufficient excitons but
before losses start settling in. In this case, STA and polaron quenching
dominate and cause the typical EQE roll off.

![Performance characteristics for two common poly(phenylenevinylene) (Super Yellow) devices [ITO (100nm)/PEDOT (30nm)/Super Yellow (70nm)/Calcium (5nm)/Aluminium (60nm)] that was made as part of training. a) Typical current density-luminance-voltage (J-V-L) graph. b) EQE as a function of current density.](images/JVLSY.pdf){#fig-perfo}

#### Pulse Measurements

At high current densities, OLEDs experience degradation due to Joule
heating, an effect that causes dark spots on the emitting pixel area of
the OLED. Under DC measurement, Joule heating is amplified. So it
becomes essential to not only use short voltage pulse to one avoid Joule
heating, but also to observe transient electroluminescence. This is
useful because triplet excitons, because they are long-lived, can be
reduced under pulse regime. This leads to reduction in induced
absoprtion losses. In other words, a pulse measurement can achieve a
high singlet population before the triplet excitons approach a
steady-stage. The rates of bimolecular process, as well as decay rates,
can be analysed and calculated via the transient pulse
electroluminescence. No calculations are done in this thesis, but
inclusion of this sets the foundation for the next step.

### Organic semiconductor lasers

Despite this thesis not containing any fabrication of lasers, it is
still important to discuss what a laser is and how organic
semiconductors can achieve lasing. Lasing was first achieved using ruby
crystals [@RN92], with organic molecules following close after with
optically pumped lasers [@RN93; @RN94]. It was not until 1996 that the
first organic semiconductor solid-state laser was developed [@RN8],
which was the first step towards reaching organic semiconductor lasers
(OSL) that are able to display the entire visible spectrum. OSLs are
even at the stage of demonstrating lasing while on flexible substrates
[@RN95] and low-threshold operation [@RN96], but no stable electrically
pumped lasers. In this section, optically pumped lasers will be
elucidated.

#### Optical gain

An external light source pumps an amplification (gain) medium, where
population inversion occurs between two states. Two-level mediums are
not practical for lasing, so the four-level system is employed to obtain
low-threshold operation. Such a four-level system has an optical
excitation from the ground state $\ket{1}$ to a the excited state
$\ket{2}$ (see @fig-laserpath). The excited state relaxes to a lower
excited state $\ket{2}$ that decays radiatively via the laser transition
(3). This means the $\ket{3}$ state has to the most populated state and
the $\ket{2}$ state be virtually unpopulated because of its fast
lifetime. Population inversion is when state $\ket{3}$ has a higher
population than state $\ket{4}$. When this inversion happens, stimulated
emission can be achieved, where an incoming photon resonates with the
excited state and causes a radiative decay with the same wavelength,
polarization, phase, and direction as the incoming photon. This process
is \"stimulated\" because it needs an incident photon and it results in
coherent light.

In organic semiconductors, this process happens between the excitonic
ground state $S_0$ and the excited singlet state $S_1$, along with their
higher vibrational levels. Hence, organic semiconductors are inherently
four-level systems.

![Left: A Jablonski diagram that shows the pathways of a four-level system. Radiative transfers of energy are the (1) and (3) pathway; (2) and (4) are relaxation process. Right: the intrinsic four-level system of an organic semiconductor is due to the additional vibronic energy levels at the ground state and excited state.](images/laserpath.pdf){#fig-laserpath}


## Laser Structures

There are a few different resonator types that enable lasing, such as
planar micro-cavities, Fabry-Perot cavities, micro-ring, microdisk, and
microspherical resonators. Though distributed feedback (DFB) resonators
can tune the wavelength by altering the period the light travels in the
optical gain material. This is done by changing the film thickness to
alter the effective refractive index. A simple OSL structure is shown in
Figure [1.12](#images/laseramp){reference-type="ref"
reference="images/laseramp"}.

A simple organic semiconductor laser needs to have lower losses than the
total gain/amplification to achieve lasing. This total gain is dependent
on the stimulated emission cross-section $\sigma_{em}$. The losses
depend on reabsorption or other exciton quenching pathways, as well as
cavity losses. The lasing condition is the electric field $E_0$ of the
confined light being able to replicate the same path
$$E_0 = E_0 exp(i4\pi nL/\lambda_0)\sqrt{R_1R_2e^{2L(g-\alpha)}}$$ where
$R_1$ and $R_2$ are the reflectivities of the mirrors $L$ distance
apart, $\lambda_0$ is the vacuum wavelength, $g$ and $\alpha$ are the
modal gain and loss respectively [@RN97]. There must be intervals of
acceptable length L because of the imaginary component. This condition
can be written $$L = \frac{\lambda_0}{2n}m$$ where m is an integer. As
mentioned previously, the modal gain $g$ must be higher than the
combines losses, written mathematically [@RN97]
$$g \geq \alpha - \frac{ln(R_1R_2)}{2L}$$ To understand gain better, a
look at the population dynamics of the levels. Spontaneous emission from
$S_1$ to $S_0$ $N_{10}$ is governed by
$$\partial N_{10} = N_1A_{10}\partial t$$ but is changed when undergoing
stimulated emission: $$\partial N_{10} = N_1u(\lambda)B_{10}\partial t$$
where $N_1$ is the poulation of the $S_1$ state, $u(\lambda)$ is the
photon density, and $A$ and $B$ are the Einstein coefficients. Because
stimulated emission is now dependent on the Einstein coefficient $B$,
the gain of the material is now too. And because
$B \propto \sigma_{em}$, we have
$$\sigma_{em} = \frac{\lambda^4E_f(\lambda)}{8\pi n^2c\tau_f}$$ where
$n$ is the average refractive index of the gain medium, $c$ is the speed
of light, $\tau_f$ is the fluorescence lifetime of the emissive lyaer,
and $E_f(\lambda)$ is the spectral distribution of its PLQY. From this
formula, we can see to optimise the stimulated-emission cross section,
and hence the gain, a low $\tau_f$ (fast decay) and high PLQY with
narrow spectra is needed.

![A mirror, gain medium, semi-transparent mirror, and an external pump source all comprise the basics of a laser.](images/laseramp.pdf){#fig-laseramp}


#### Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)

Without needing to build a cavity, the prospect for lasing can be
evaluated by use of a simple waveguided structure that enables a weak
but intrinsic optical feedback. ASE still sees spectral narrowing of the
full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM), but does not exhibit coherent
emission out. This is because, while population inversion has occurred,
spontaneous emission dominates the system instead of stimulation
emission.
