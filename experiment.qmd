# []{#sec:exp label="sec:exp"} Experimental Method and Materials

This chapter will describe the methodology of device fabrication and the
materials used. Fabrication of organic light emitting diodes were the
principle experiment. So this chapter will include the steps of
fabrication, along with the analysis and testing of said devices. The
number of devices tests, and number of measurements, along with
uncertainty will be spoken about in their respective chapters.

## Materials

The organic semiconductor materials that were used in this thesis were
primarily small molecular organic semiconductors. All of these layers were thermally
evaporated under vacuum.

## OLED Fabrication

All fabrication was conducted within the Class 1000 clean room at the
Centre of Organic Photonics and Electronics (COPE) at The University of
Queensland. The Queensland Node of the Australian National Fabrication
Faacility (ANFF) maintained and established some of the procedures and
equipment that was also needed to complete fabrication. All OLEDs in
this thesis were fabricated using thermal evaporation

### Cleaning substrates

To begin, OLEDs need to have transparent window to view the light from.
A pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) layer on a 100 nm thick glass
substrate was used as the window. They were sourced from Xin Yan
Technology and require cleaning before deposition of organic layers to
improve charge injection into the emissive layer. The cleaning process
follows these sequential steps.

1.  Sonicate substrates in dionised (DI) water with detergent (Alconox)
    for 5 minutees

2.  Heat substrates at 150 $\degree C$ for 15 minutes in same DI water
    with Alconox

3.  Sonicate substrates in DI water for 5 minutes

4.  Sonicate substrates in Acetone for 5 minutes

5.  Sonicate substrates in Isoproponaol for 5 minutes

6.  Blow dried with high pressure nitrogen gun

7.  UV-Ozone treatment for 45 minutes

The culmination of the cleaning with UV-Ozone is to remove the organic
impurities and improve the wetibility of the substrates.

### Layer Deposition

The hole transport layer is the first layer to be deposited onto the
clean substrate. Followed by the emissive layer. In the case of
host/guest systems, the emissive layer involved simultaneous thermal
deposition. The electron transport layer is deposited next. Finally
capped off with the cathode deposition. To obtain the desired area of
emission, a laser cut steel stencil was placed over the devices. There
are a few sizes of the active areas (pixels), but in this report
$0.3 mm^2$, $0.75 mm^2$, and $4 mm^2$ were used.

### Thermal Evaporation

The thermal evaporation equipment (MBraun Inert-gas Systeme, Gmbh) could
reach a vacuum of $~10^{-6} mbar$, which enabled for organic materials
to be heated (evaporated) onto the pre-cleaned substrates. To heat the
organic materials a voltage was passed to the aluminium oxide crucibles
(1 & 2) that contained the powered form of the material (see @fig-evap). Inorganic
materials (Calcium and Aluminium) were deposited in different holders (5
& 6). Two Quartz Crystal Monitors (QCM, 8 & 9) measured the rate of
deposition, which enabled calculation of deposition thickness. In order
to deposit the layers uniformly, not only were the substrates put in a
rotatable holder (11) that could close off deposition (10) if need be,
but a specified calibration factor for each material was used to predict
consistent deposition. The evaporation rates were kept between $0.1-1$
Å/s to avoid piercing the layer beneath. Additional covers (3, 4 & 7)
were used as safety in case of sudden increase of deposition rate.
Previous experiments have provided accuracy of the QCM-measured
thickness by using a Dektak XT profilometer (Bruker) to scratch the film
and measure the step distance between the top surface of the film and
substrate.

### DC Measurements

Two separate apparatuses were used to measure DC measurements of the
OLEDs, depending on the size of heir emission area. For $4mm^2$ areas,
the devices were placed within an integrating sphere (Hamamatsu
Photonics C9920-12) coupled with a Keithley 2400 source meter. The
Electroluminescence spectra was recorded using a fibre coupled PMA-12
Photonic multi-channel analyser. These measurements were performed in a
nitrogen-filled glove-box with low $O_2$ and moisture content.

The small area devices ($0.75mm^2$ and $0.3mm^2$) needed to be
encapsulated so that they could be transported to the transient response
apparatus. These OLEDs were tested with a pre-calibrated photomultiplier
tube (PMT, Hamamatsu H10721-20) coupled with a Keithley 2400 source
meter. The electroluminescence spectra was measured with a CCD
spectrometer (Thor labs, CCS100). A LabVIEW program could collate the
voltage, current, luminance, and spectra to calculate the external
quantum efficiency (EQE).

The PMT first needed to be calibrated to convert photocurrent into
luminance. This was done by setting the distance between the PMT and
device to a fixed value for a given emissive pixel area A. To verify the
calibration it is possible to use a luminance meter (Konica Minolta
LS100). The calibration factor scales the relationship between
photocurrent and pixel area A to give luminance L.

Total luminance L output is not the same brightness that the human eye
sees because of how the eye responds to different wavelengths. The total
power of the emitted signal the human recognises is given by
$$Power = \frac{\phi_{lum}}{683}\times \frac{\int EL(\lambda)d\lambda}{\int ER(\lambda)\times EL(\lambda)d\lambda}$$
where $\phi_{lum} = \pi\times L \times A$, $EL(\lambda)$ is the
normalised distribution of the electroluminescence signal, $ER(\lambda)$
is the eye response function, and the $683 lm/W$ constant is the flux at
the peak wavelength of 555nm of $ER(\lambda)$. This power can then be
used to calculate the number of photons ($n_p$) emitted by the device
using
$$n_p = \frac{\int EL(\lambda)\lambda d\lambda}{\int ER(\lambda)\times EL(\lambda)d\lambda} \times \frac{1}{hc} \times Power$$
where $h$ and $c$ are Planck's constant and the speed of light
respectively. Comparing this to the current $I=e\times n_e$, a ratio of
number of electrons $n_e$ injected to total number of photons out $n_e$
provides us with the definition of external quantum efficiency (EQE).
Refer to @fig-perfo to see the J-V-L characteristics of a test OLED
with Super Yellow as the emissive layer.

### Pulse Measurements

Lasing required pulse measurements due to the need to inject high
current densities without massive losses, such as Joule heating and
avoid long triplet exciton times. So testing the OLED devices under a
pulse regime is necessary to elucidate the transient behaviour. Pulse
widths range from nanosecond to microsecond lifetime to observe the
non-linear processes such as charge transport, exciton formation, and
exciton annihilation processes (TTA).

To output voltage pulses, high-speed electrical pulse generators
(AV-1011B1-B) and AVTECH AVRK-3-B) were utilised to deliver pulses with
maximum 500 V, 3-6 ns rise and fall times, and 1 kHz operational
frequency (see @fig-pulse). The current was measured using a ultra fast
current probe (Integrated Sensor Technology, 711 UHF) that fed, as well
as the electroluminescence response (PMT), into a digital oscilloscope
(Teledyne LeCroy) with resolution of 2 GHz. The cables connecting each
equipment piece had resistance of $50 \Omega$ and placed without bends
to reduce wave-guided losses and current reflections.
