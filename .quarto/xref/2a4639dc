Holes are injected from the anode into the hole transport layer (HTL) such that the holes then have an easier time entering the emissive layer. Similar to the anode, electrons enter from the cathode into the electron transport layer (ETL). Electrons and holes recombine in the light emitting layer (EML), forming an exciton that has four possible permutations: three triplet states each with a total spin of 1, and one singlet state with a total spin of zero.","order":{"number":7,"section":[1,5,0,1,0,0,0]},"key":"fig-elephants"},{"caption":"1.5 Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)","order":{"number":2,"section":[1,5,0,0,0,0,0]},"key":"sec-OLED"},{"caption":"","parent":"fig-elephants","order":{"number":1},"key":"fig-wideA"},{"caption":"Performance characteristics for two common poly(phenylenevinylene) (Super Yellow) devices [ITO (100nm)/PEDOT (30nm)/Super Yellow (70nm)/Calcium (5nm)/Aluminium (60nm)] that was made as part of training. a) Typical current density-luminance-voltage (J-V-L) graph. b) EQE as a function of current density.","order":{"number":11,"section":[1,5,1,1,0,0,0]},"key":"fig-perfo"},{"caption":"HOMO-LUMO energy diagram for organic semiconductors showing the electron affinity (EA), ionization potential (IP), and the bad gap in relation to the energy needed to reach vacuum","order":{"number":1,"section":[1,2,0,0,0,0,0]},"key":"fig-homo"},{"caption":"Basic transitions within an organic molecule between the ground state S_0 and the excited singlet S_1, S_2,… S_n and triplet states T_1, T_2,… T_n, represented in a Jablonski diagram","order":{"number":3,"section":[1,2,0,0,0,0,0]},"key":"fig-absorb"},{"caption":"","parent":"fig-elephants","order":{"number":2},"key":"fig-wideB"},{"caption":"1.2 Optical properties of organic semiconductors","order":{"number":1,"section":[1,2,0,0,0,0,0]},"key":"sec-opti"},{"caption":"Förster resonance energy transfer is a dipole-dipole interaction, where in the absence of a photon, the Donor D releases energy that is reabsorbed by the acceptor A.
