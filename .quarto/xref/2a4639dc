Holes are injected from the anode into the hole transport layer (HTL) such that the holes then have an easier time entering the emissive layer. Similar to the anode, electrons enter from the cathode into the electron transport layer (ETL). Electrons and holes recombine in the light emitting layer (EML), forming an exciton that has four possible permutations: three triplet states each with a total spin of 1, and one singlet state with a total spin of zero.","key":"fig-elephants","order":{"section":[1,5,0,1,0,0,0],"number":7}},{"caption":"The bimolecular annihilation process are displayed in relation to singlets S1, triplets T1, and polarons e and h.
