Fabrication of organic light emitting diodes were the\nprinciple experiment. So this chapter will include the steps of\nfabrication, along with the analysis and testing of said devices. The\nnumber of devices tests, and number of measurements, along with\nuncertainty will be spoken about in their respective chapters.\n\n## Materials\n\nThe organic semiconductor materials that were used in this thesis were\nprimarily small molecular organic semiconductors. All of these layers were thermally\nevaporated under vacuum.\n\n## OLED Fabrication\n\nAll fabrication was conducted within the Class 1000 clean room at the\nCentre of Organic Photonics and Electronics (COPE) at The University of\nQueensland. The Queensland Node of the Australian National Fabrication\nFaacility (ANFF) maintained and established some of the procedures and\nequipment that was also needed to complete fabrication. All OLEDs in\nthis thesis were fabricated using thermal evaporation\n\n### Cleaning substrates\n\nTo begin, OLEDs need to have transparent window to view the light from.\nA pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) layer on a 100 nm thick glass\nsubstrate was used as the window. They were sourced from Xin Yan\nTechnology and require cleaning before deposition of organic layers to\nimprove charge injection into the emissive layer. The cleaning process\nfollows these sequential steps.\n\n1.  Sonicate substrates in dionised (DI) water with detergent (Alconox)\n    for 5 minutees\n\n2.  Heat substrates at 150 $\\degree C$ for 15 minutes in same DI water\n    with Alconox\n\n3.  Sonicate substrates in DI water for 5 minutes\n\n4.  Sonicate substrates in Acetone for 5 minutes\n\n5.  Sonicate substrates in Isoproponaol for 5 minutes\n\n6.  Blow dried with high pressure nitrogen gun\n\n7.  UV-Ozone treatment for 45 minutes\n\nThe culmination of the cleaning with UV-Ozone is to remove the organic\nimpurities and improve the wetibility of the substrates.\n\n### Layer Deposition\n\nThe hole transport layer is the first layer to be deposited onto the\nclean substrate. Followed by the emissive layer. In the case of\nhost/guest systems, the emissive layer involved simultaneous thermal\ndeposition. The electron transport layer is deposited next. Finally\ncapped off with the cathode deposition. To obtain the desired area of\nemission, a laser cut steel stencil was placed over the devices. There\nare a few sizes of the active areas (pixels), but in this report\n$0.3 mm^2$, $0.75 mm^2$, and $4 mm^2$ were used.\n\n### Thermal Evaporation\n\nThe thermal evaporation equipment (MBraun Inert-gas Systeme, Gmbh) could\nreach a vacuum of $~10^{-6} mbar$, which enabled for organic materials\nto be heated (evaporated) onto the pre-cleaned substrates. To heat the\norganic materials a voltage was passed to the aluminium oxide crucibles\n(1 & 2) that contained the powered form of the material (see @fig-evap). Inorganic\nmaterials (Calcium and Aluminium) were deposited in different holders (5\n& 6). Two Quartz Crystal Monitors (QCM, 8 & 9) measured the rate of\ndeposition, which enabled calculation of deposition thickness. In order\nto deposit the layers uniformly, not only were the substrates put in a\nrotatable holder (11) that could close off deposition (10) if need be,\nbut a specified calibration factor for each material was used to predict\nconsistent deposition. The evaporation rates were kept between $0.1-1$\nÅ/s to avoid piercing the layer beneath. Additional covers (3, 4 & 7)\nwere used as safety in case of sudden increase of deposition rate.\nPrevious experiments have provided accuracy of the QCM-measured\nthickness by using a Dektak XT profilometer (Bruker) to scratch the film\nand measure the step distance between the top surface of the film and\nsubstrate.\n\n![Schematic representation of the vacuum thermal evaporation chamber used to deposit thin films. Aluminium and calcium sit upon metal holders that have a current passed through it to heat it up (5 & 6).

For $4mm^2$ areas,\nthe devices were placed within an integrating sphere (Hamamatsu\nPhotonics C9920-12) coupled with a Keithley 2400 source meter. The\nElectroluminescence spectra was recorded using a fibre coupled PMA-12\nPhotonic multi-channel analyser. These measurements were performed in a\nnitrogen-filled glove-box with low $O_2$ and moisture content.\n\nThe small area devices ($0.75mm^2$ and $0.3mm^2$) needed to be\nencapsulated so that they could be transported to the transient response\napparatus. These OLEDs were tested with a pre-calibrated photomultiplier\ntube (PMT, Hamamatsu H10721-20) coupled with a Keithley 2400 source\nmeter. The electroluminescence spectra was measured with a CCD\nspectrometer (Thor labs, CCS100). A LabVIEW program could collate the\nvoltage, current, luminance, and spectra to calculate the external\nquantum efficiency (EQE).\n\nThe PMT first needed to be calibrated to convert photocurrent into\nluminance. This was done by setting the distance between the PMT and\ndevice to a fixed value for a given emissive pixel area A. To verify the\ncalibration it is possible to use a luminance meter (Konica Minolta\nLS100). The calibration factor scales the relationship between\nphotocurrent and pixel area A to give luminance L.\n\nTotal luminance L output is not the same brightness that the human eye\nsees because of how the eye responds to different wavelengths. The total\npower of the emitted signal the human recognises is given by\n$$Power = \\frac{\\phi_{lum}}{683}\\times \\frac{\\int EL(\\lambda)d\\lambda}{\\int ER(\\lambda)\\times EL(\\lambda)d\\lambda}$$\nwhere $\\phi_{lum} = \\pi\\times L \\times A$, $EL(\\lambda)$ is the\nnormalised distribution of the electroluminescence signal, $ER(\\lambda)$\nis the eye response function, and the $683 lm/W$ constant is the flux at\nthe peak wavelength of 555nm of $ER(\\lambda)$. This power can then be\nused to calculate the number of photons ($n_p$) emitted by the device\nusing\n$$n_p = \\frac{\\int EL(\\lambda)\\lambda d\\lambda}{\\int ER(\\lambda)\\times EL(\\lambda)d\\lambda} \\times \\frac{1}{hc} \\times Power$$\nwhere $h$ and $c$ are Planck's constant and the speed of light\nrespectively. Comparing this to the current $I=e\\times n_e$, a ratio of\nnumber of electrons $n_e$ injected to total number of photons out $n_e$\nprovides us with the definition of external quantum efficiency (EQE).\nRefer to @fig-perfo to see the J-V-L characteristics of a test OLED\nwith Super Yellow as the emissive layer.\n\n\n![Normalised eye response curve as per the CIE 1931 standard in relation to the emission spectra of DPA/Coumarin6 host/guest system that can be found in the final section.](images/EyeResponse.pdf){#fig-eye}\n\n### Pulse Measurements\n\n![Schematic diagram of high voltage pulse measurement apparatus. Reduction of signal reflection was achieved by using 50 <span class=\"math inline\"><em>Ω</em></span> resistance cables and terminating the instruments at the same resistance.](images/Pulse.pdf){#fig-pulse}\n\nLasing required pulse measurements due to the need to inject high\ncurrent densities without massive losses, such as Joule heating and\navoid long triplet exciton times. So testing the OLED devices under a\npulse regime is necessary to elucidate the transient behaviour. Pulse\nwidths range from nanosecond to microsecond lifetime to observe the\nnon-linear processes such as charge transport, exciton formation, and\nexciton annihilation processes (TTA).\n\nTo output voltage pulses, high-speed electrical pulse generators\n(AV-1011B1-B) and AVTECH AVRK-3-B) were utilised to deliver pulses with\nmaximum 500 V, 3-6 ns rise and fall times, and 1 kHz operational\nfrequency (see @fig-pulse). The current was measured using a ultra fast\ncurrent probe (Integrated Sensor Technology, 711 UHF) that fed, as well\nas the electroluminescence response (PMT), into a digital oscilloscope\n(Teledyne LeCroy) with resolution of 2 GHz. The cables connecting each\nequipment piece had resistance of $50 \\Omega$ and placed without bends\nto reduce wave-guided losses and current reflections.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","pdf-engine":"pdflatex","output-file":"experiment.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","bibliography":["references.bib"],"comments":{"hypothesis":true},"toc-location":"right","toc-title":"On this page:","code-copy":true,"theme":"lux"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"pdflatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"experiment.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"comments":{"hypothesis":true},"documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
