Coumarin caan be confied between the\nlarge singlet-triplet energy level gap of 2,6-DPA, which enables\ntransfer of singlets to the guest, and triplets from the guest to host\nfor further TTU (see Figure [@fig:ttucoumarin]). The OLED structure can\nbe found in Appendix\n[\\[apen:oledex\\]](#apen:oledex){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"apen:oledex\"}. 2,6-DPA/Coumarin6 was based in OLEDs that were\nthen tested and analysed under steady state and microsecond pulse\nexcitation. The low $wt\\%$ of Coumarin6 guest is to avoid separation of\nthe chromophores of 2,6-DPA. That way the Dexter energy transfer of\ntriplet-triplet annihilation can happen frequently. A similar doping\napproach has been used to obtain high EQEs due to TTU [@RN73], and\nreduce STA in optically pumped lasers [@RN149]. Herein, I found that\n2,6-DPA/Coumarin6 host/guest exhibits the TTU mechanism to generate\nextra singlet excitons, yet does not achieve a better performance than\nnon-doped. At low-current densities (J) the EQE of the device increases\nproportionally to $J$ because of the absence of dominating\nsinglet-triplet annihilation (STA). At high current densities, STA\nbecomes a significant loss causing a reduction in EQE and gain. The\ntransition between the dominating regions of\n$T{transition}\\>(k_{TTU}\\tau)^-1$ and the inverse are clearly visible,\nyet the transient electroluminescence does not demonstrate promising\nresults. Herein, I will explain the promise of these preliminary results\nregarding TTU and coumarin6.\n\n![The triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion process in 2,6-DPA/Coumarin6 host-guest system.

Each layer was thermally evaporated under high vacuum\n($10^-6 mbar)$ without break to avoid atmosphere exposure. The\ndeposition rate for the organic layers were between $0.3 - 0.6 Å/s$.\nTo achieve $~1-2wt\\%$ , a simultaneous doping of coumarin6 and 2,6-DPA\ndeposition with rates $0.01Å/s$ and $1Å/s$ minimum was required.\nThe thermal evaporator's smallest deposition rate was $0.01Å/s$ so\nthis become quite troublesome to manage. Exceeding $1Å/s$ is not\npreferable due to piercing of the beneath layer. The thickness and\nstructure was chosen as per the OLEDs made in the previous section to best compare device performance difference.\nThe spectra showed a pale green emission (peak 520 nm).\n\n::: {#fig-cstuff layout-ncol=2}\n\n![](images/coumarinspectra.pdf){#fig-cspectra}\n\n![](images/CoumarinJVL.pdf){#fig-cjvl}\n\n![](images/coumarinEQE.pdf){#fig-ceqe}\n\n![](images/Coumarinslope.pdf){#fig-cslope}\n\n\nFigure (a) Electroluminescence spectra of neat film 2,6-DPA compared to it doped in <span class=\"math inline\">1<em>w</em><em>t</em>%</span> Coumarin6 (b) Current density-luminance-voltage (J-V-L) graph of 2,6-DPA/Coumarin6 neat films (b) EQE versus current density graph of doped films (d) Luminance versus current density graph showing the two regimes of TTU-dominant and STA-dominant\n\n:::\n\nFour neat film devices were fabricated each having eight pixels (four\n$0.75mm^2$ and four $0.3mm^2$). Due to faulty contacts, thermal\nevaporation alignment issues, and scratches or blemishes on the\nsubstrate window some pixels become unable to be tested. Others can\ndegrade whilst a voltage is applied. In these doped-OLEDs, a majority\nwere unstable due to fabrication issues. A few pixels managed to\nsurvive. A turn-on voltage of $3.6\\pm0.2$ V was achieved at the defined\n$1 cd/m^2$, with the maximum brightness approaching $2300\\pm1000 cd/m^2$\nat $10\\pm0.2$ V. The large uncertainty for maximum brightness is too\naccount for minimal pixel survival rate. The J-V-L characteristics of\nthe doped film and the EQE versus current density graph can be found in\n@fig-cjvl and @fig-ceqe. A roll up of EQE\n(peak $0.16\\pm0.10$%) until $~500\\pm200 mA/cm^2$ demonstrates early\ntriplet-triplet upconversion gain (see @fig-ceqe). The peak EQE of\nthis device, however, do not exceed the theoretical maximum EQE of\n$~2.25\\%$. It also is noticeably lower than 2,6-DPA neat film. This\ncould be due to failure to achieve $1-2wt\\%$ because of limitations with\nthe thermal evaporator. It could also be device structure that might not\npresent good injection of charges. The doped film exhibits similar\nluminance-current density trends with its distinct two-regimes of slope\n$>1$ and $<1$ (see @fig-cslope). The transition current density is roughly\n$900\\pm100 mA/cm^2$. The slope is $<2$ due to imperfect TTU and losses,\nsuch as STA and other quenching. An observed slope shift from $>1$ to\n$<1$ indicates definite gain of triplet to singlet excitons.\n\nPulse measurements (transient electroluminescence) will demonstrate the\npopulation dynamics of the excitons even to high current densities. The\ndevice area used was $0.7mm^2$ to reduce geometrical capacitance that\nminimises RC response distortion. For doped films, a long pulse width\n($1.5\\mu s$) was used to extrapolate the affect STA had on fluorescent\nmaterials at high current densities. Whilst DC measurements only reached\ncurrent densities of $1 A/cm^2$, pulse measurements reach densities of\n$>2.5 A/cm^2$. At high current densities, doped and non-doped devices\nshow a sharp rise, characteristic of space charge limited current\nconditions), with the initial rise lifetime of $~80 ns$. This is\ncharacteristic of TTU devices because of the recycling nature of the\ntriplet excitons generating additional singlets. At high current\ndensities (40 V) the steady state shows decrease over time, indicating\nSTA has dominated rate over the TTU generation rate (see @fig-cslope). This decrease is\nmore than the neat-film, indicating that TTU either is not as present or\nSTA is more dominant. At lower current densities, STA is not prevalent\nso a steady state is visible. STA dominates via FRET, a process that is\ndetermined by the spectral overlap between $S_1$ emission and\n$T_1\\rightarrow T_n$ absorption bands.\n\n::: {#fig-cslope layout=\"[[1,1], [1]]\"}\n\n![](images/coumarinPULSE.pdf){#fig-cpulsed}\n\n![](images/coumarinfitslope.pdf){#fig-cfitslope}\n\n![](images/coumarinslopedata.pdf){#fig-cslopedata}\n\n\nFigure (a) Transient EL spectra of doped 2,6-DPA with Coumarin6 with a 1500 ns pulse width for many voltages. (b) Log-log plot of the delayed fluorescence showing a slope of  2 matching TTU contribution (c) percentage fall from steady state to delayed fluorescence\n\n:::\n\n\nThe turn off electroluminescence of pulse measurements also provide\nuseful information. For TTU devices, a prompt decay is expected after\nvoltage turn off due to the loss of direct singlet generation, followed\nby a delayed fluorescence (DF) bimolecular decay function\n$$EL_{DF} = \\frac{1}{(a+bt)^2}$$ where $a$ and $b$ are constants. This\ncharacteristic slope of $~2$ in a log-log plot can be observed in these\ndoped devices at low current density. The delayed component is $~61\\%$\nof the steady state (near TTU max) at $15V$.\n\n### Discussion\n\n2,6-DPA is an anthracene derivative with low PLQY and moderate charge\nmobility in amorphous state. It can be doped with a higher PLQY material\nto improve the overall efficiency. In neat film OLEDs, 2,6-DPA shows\ndistinctive TTU properties such as distinctive regimes as seen in\nthe mCBP OLEDs. This chapter uses the TTU property of 2,6-DPA\nto transfer singlets to Coumarin6 via FRET (see @fig-ttucoumarin). A low $wt\\%$ Coumarin6 was doped as to\nnot separate the chromophores of 2,6-DPA, such that it would not extend\nthe triplet states beyond the short-range Dexter energy transfer\nprocess. This was successful as the doped OLED showed trends of TTU.\nDespite the peak EQE not surpassing the theoretical maximum of typical\nfluorescent emitters -- a feat that would confirm extra exciton\ngeneration -- the evidence presented here is a good start in showing\nthis doped system exhibits TTU. To increase device performance,\noptimisation of fabrication process and device structure needs to be\nconsidered specific to an a 2,6-DPA/Coumarin6 host-guest systems.\nFurther optimisation of the thermal evaporation process would also\nincrease the pixel survivability and stability.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","pdf-engine":"pdflatex","output-file":"coumarin6.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","bibliography":["references.bib"],"comments":{"hypothesis":true},"toc-location":"right","toc-title":"On this page:","code-copy":true,"theme":"lux"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"pdflatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"coumarin6.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"comments":{"hypothesis":true},"documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
