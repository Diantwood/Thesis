What makes organic lasers of\nspecial interest is not only the ability to easily alter their chemical\nstructure to obtain desired features -- such as tunability through the\nvisible spectrum -- but also that they kept the benefits of their\norganic siblings: organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)\n[@RN1; @RN3; @RN4; @RN5; @RN6; @RN8]. The rapid and extensive\ndevelopment of organic semiconductors (OLEDs did the heavy lifting) gave\nthe proverbial shoulders for organic lasers to stand on. However,\ndespite the sturdy and broad shoulders of the OLED industry, the\nrealisation of *organic laser diodes* remains elusive.\n\nAn organic semiconductor laser diode (OSLD) is a device pumped\n(injected) with a current rather than pumped optically (with an external\nlight source) -- in the same way inorganic semiconductor lasers work\n[@RN4]. OSLDs in particular have received a favourable gaze from\nresearches because of their low cost, tunable wavelength from visible to\nthe infrared region, and their ability to be mounted on flexible\nsubstrates as part of an optical circuit [@RN9]. Achieving an OSLD would\nreduce the need for an external pumping device, reduce costs, and open\nnew applications in bioanalytics and spectroscopy [@RN81]. However,\nachieving efficient OSLDs have proved to be a quite significant\nchallenge [@RN10; @RN11; @RN12; @RN13; @RN14]; yet a 2019 paper by A.\nSandanayaka *et al.* shows promising lasing properties using a\nconventional OLED under electrical pumping [@RN15]. This development, as\nwell as more recent OSLD advances\n[@RN9; @RN15; @RN16; @RN17; @RN18; @RN19], demonstrates that we are on\nthe precipice of achieving stable OSLDs despite the major challenges.\n\nThese challenges mainly concern but are not limited to the optical\nlosses from electrical contacts and electrical losses induced by\nspin-triplets and polarons at high current densities [@RN15; @RN20].\nBoth these losses are due to the spin-triplet states typically being\nunable to contribute to electrically pumped lasing [@RN18], which means\nthe current density lasing threshold increases [@RN4; @RN18]. In other\nwords, a larger current must be injected to overcome this threshold, but\nas more current is injected, more spin-triplets are created, which in\nturn induce more losses [@RN18]. This negative feedback loop lies at the\ncore of realising organic semiconductor laser diodes. Fortunately for\nus, we can apply the techniques used by OLEDs to turn the spin-triplets\ninto laser contributing excitons, such that all generated excitons\ncontribute to lasing. The main three strategies that have been employed\nto harness triplets are thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)\n[@RN23; @RN24; @RN25], phosphorescence [@RN22], and triplet-triplet\nannihilation (TTA) upconversion [@RN26; @RN27; @RN28]. Recently, the\nsame strategies have been attempted to realise OSLDs, see Refs\n[@RN18; @RN30; @RN29; @RN21].\n\nHerein this thesis demonstrates the potential for a highly emissive\nlasing material, 3-(2-Benzothiazolyl)-N,N-diethylumbelliferylamine\n(Coumarin6), doped into 2,6-diphenylanthracene (2,6-DPA) to achieve\nlow-lasing thresholds via the triplet-triplet annihilation strategy.\nThis guest/host system will generate singlets in the 2,6-DPA via\ntriplet-triplet upconversion and then transfer them to the lasing guest\nto hopefully give a higher photoluminescence yield. The thesis will be\nstructured into two parts: the confirmation of triplet-triplet\nannihilation upconversion in a neat film 2,6-DPA and the realisation of\nefficient host/guest system using the lasing material coumarin6 for\nprospects of lasing. The testing of these organic lasing materials will\nbe done via simple OLED device architectures. Even though this report\ndoes not consider fabrication of lasers, it will include an in-depth\n(although non exhaustive) description of the physics of lasers. Hence,\nthis thesis will set the foundations of organic semiconductor lasers to,\nmetaphorically, lay the initial concrete for the 'path to electrically\npumped organic lasers'.\n\n## []{#sec:level2 label=\"sec:level2\"}Organic semiconductors\n\nThe best way to introduce organic semiconductor laser diodes is to begin\nwith how the phrase starts: organic semiconductor. First the basics of\norganic semiconductors (OSCs) will be introduced, followed by the\nunderlying photophysics of organic semiconductors. Then the optical and\nelectrical properties of OSCs will be elucidated, subsequently followed\nby the energy transfer mechanisms. Next is where triplet-triplet\nannihilation will be introduced. Naturally, the various losses in\norganic semiconductors will be explored next. To tie it into how to test\norganic semiconductors, organic light emitting diodes will set the stage\nfor the rest of the thesis. Finally, organic laser diodes and the\nphysics of lasers will be included to put this all into context of\nlasers.\n\n### General properties of organic semiconductors\n\nOrganic compounds contain a covalently bound carbon atom, whose binding\nconfigurations enable more than 19 million different possible organic\ncompounds each with various properties [@RN81]. It is easy to alter the\norganic compound's molecular structure, which is extremely fortunate for\noptoelectronic applications since their optical and electrical\nproperties depend on their structure. In 1976, the discovery of\nconducting polymers began the journey of new generation polymers that\nhad electrical and optical properties of metals or semiconductors, while\nretaining the benefits of easily processed polymers [@RN82].\n\nCarbon atoms can bond to each other in single, double, and triple bonds.\nOrganic compounds that have exclusively single bonds (four bonds per\ncarbon atom) are unable to conduct electricity due to the binding energy\nof a single bond being in the ground state. Hence these molecules (e.g.\npolystyrene) cannot be used for electronics apart from cladding of\nelectric cables.\n\nMolecules that have alternating single and double bonds are called\nconjugated molecules. In a conjugated molecule, the carbon atoms form\nthree strongly bound $\\sigma$-bonds and one weakly bound $\\pi$-bond. The\nskeletal structure of the polymer is formed by the $\\sigma$-bonds, with\nthe delocalized $\\pi$-electrons (comprising the $\\pi$-bonds) able to\ntravel along the polymer chain. The $\\pi$-electron (binding energy of\n$1 eV$) upon excitation can go to the anti-binding $\\pi^*$-state, where\nthe distance between comprises the commonly known band gap. Typically,\nfor these conjugated molecules, the band gap is around $2.5 eV$. These\nconjugated molecules exhibit semiconducting properties because of their\nability to transport charges along the polymer chain.\n\nThere are a few classes of organic semiconductors. One class is\n$\\pi$-conjugated polymers that can be processed from solution by\nspin-coating. While this technique is cheap and feasible over large\nareas, the ability to create multilayer devices is inhibited by the\nfailure to dissolve all layers. Light emission from electrical\ninjection, or electroluminescence, was first observed in 1990 using\nconjugated molecules [@RN6]. Similarly, optically pumped lasers were\nshown in 1996 [@RN8; @RN32].\n\nAnother class is small molecules that have low-molecular weight. These\nmolecules also have delocalized $\\pi$-electrons. This class can be\nprocessed by thermal evaporation under high vacuum. While this technique\nrequires specialised equipment, the technique benefits from deposition\nof multilayer devices of arbitrary combinations. Evaporating multiple\nmaterials simultaneously means the layers can be *doped*. Doping gives\naccess to altering the band gap characteristics of the main (host)\nmaterial, which will change the conductivity, emission, and absorption\nproperties of the material [@RN3]. Tang *et al.* [@RN35] and Adachi *et\nal.* [@RN36] demonstrated how host-dopant systems in OLEDs led to\ngreater control of emission colour and electroluminescence efficiency\n(through the guest) and control over the charge transport and\nelectron-hole pair formation and transfer (through the host). Small\nmolecule-semiconductors first saw optically pumped laser operation in\n1997 [@RN5]. The other organic semiconductor classes that have seen\nsuccessful device fabrication include single crystals (anthracene)\n[@RN31], conjugated dendrimers [@RN33], and spiro-compounds [@RN34].\nSome common organic molecules, as well as the ones present in this\nthesis, have their organic structure shown in @fig-widestruc.\n\nTo provide a quick recap, organic conjugated molecules can be excited\nelectrically and optically by photons in the visible range because of\nthe low-binding energy of the delocalized $\\pi$-electrons along the\npolymer chain. These conjugated molecules thus offer semiconducting\nproperties. The question to propel us forward is: how can these\nconjugated molecules emit all of the visible wavelengths of light? Hence\nto tackle this, next the optical properties of the conjugated molecules\nwill be discussed.\n\n## Optical properties of organic semiconductors {#sec-opti}\n\nIn the organic semiconducting picture, the electrons of the\n$\\sigma$-bond can be ignored because they are tightly bound as opposed\nto the delocalized $\\pi$-electron that can be excited between the\n$\\pi-\\pi^*$ states. The $\\pi$-state can be thought of as the ground\nstate, or the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Its counterpart\nis the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) or $\\pi^*$-state. It\nis worth noting that the band gap is the difference between the electron\naffinity (EA) of the layer and the ionization potential (IP), and it is\noften smaller than the difference between LUMO and HOMO (see @fig-homo) [@RN5]. The\nmolecules in Figure\n@fig-widestruc have their HOMO/LUMO as well as other\nproperties are shown in Table [1.1](#tab:molecules){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"tab:molecules\"}.\n\n\n\n\n![HOMO-LUMO energy diagram for organic semiconductors showing the electron affinity (EA), ionization potential (IP), and the bad gap in relation to the energy needed to reach vacuum](images/HOMOLUMO1.pdf){#fig-homo}\n\n:::{.column-page}\n   Organic molecule   Formula and molecular weight (amu)    HOMO \\[LUMO\\]                  Application                      Ref.\n  ------------------ ------------------------------------ ----------------- ----------------------------------------- ----------------\n         Alq3           $C_{27}H_{18}AlN_3O_3\\ 459.43$     $-5.7\\ [-2.9]$          Electron transport and host         [@RN37; @RN38]\n         TPBI             $C_{45}H_{30}N_6 \\ 654.76$       $-6.2 \\ [-2.7]$   Electron transport and exciton blocking      [@RN38]\n         NPB              $C_{44}H_{32}N_2 \\ 588.74$       $-5.4 \\ [-2.3]$               Hole transport                [@RN38; @RN39]\n         DPA               $C_{26}H_{18} \\ 330.42$         $-5.6 \\ [-2.6]$            Fluorescent and Host                [@RN39]\n        TMPYPB            $C_{39}H_{27}N_3\\ 537.65$        $-6.7 \\ [-2.7]$   Electron transport and exciton blocking   [@RN38; @RN39]\n         mCBP            $C_{36}H_{24}N_{2} \\ 484.6$       $-5.6\\ [-2.1]$                     Host                        [@RN40]\n         TAPC             $C_{46}H_{46}N_2 \\ 626.37$       $-5.5 \\ [-2.0]$               Hole transport                   [@RN38]\n      Coumarin6         $C_{20}H_{18}N_2O_2S \\ 350.43$     $-5.2\\ [-1.7]$           Fluorescent and laser dye             [@RN41]\n\n  : **OLED host, dopant, and charge generation molecules**\n:::\n\n::: figure*\n![The organic structures of molecules found in this thesis and their respective HOMO/LUMO levels in relation to Fermi level of common metals](images/Struct.pdf){#fig-widestruc}\n:::\n:::\nA photon can be incident upon the molecule to excite the $\\pi$-electron\nto form an electron-hole pair. This delocalized charge pair is called an\nexciton. Excitons are stable at room temperature because of their large\nbinding energy ($1 eV$) compared to its thermal activation energy\n($k_BT=25 meV$) [@RN81]. It is then easier to interpret the optical (and\nelectrical) properties in this exciton picture. Excitons have many\nexcitonic states, but the lowest is the ground state $S_0$. Each\nexcitonic state has many sub-states that offshoot energetically due to\nvibrational fluctuations (see @fig-absorb). The bandgap\nseparates the ground state $S_0$ and the first excited state $S_1$. A\nphoton can excite the exciton from the ground state to a higher vibronic\nstate of a singlet state, and then subsequently relax to the lowest\nvibronic state in 1 ps timescale. Then the lowest vibronic state of the\n$S_1$ can decay either radiatively (emitting light) or nonradiatively to\nthe groundstate with a lifetime of 1 ns. Because the absorption normally\ntransitions to a higher vibronic state and then relax to a lower\nvibronic state, the emission spectra tends to be redshifted (lower\nenergy) compared to the absorption spectra. This energy difference\nbetween the spectra is referred to as Stokes shift [@RN4; @RN81]. Lasers\nbenefit from Stokes shift because it helps reduce self absorption\nlosses.\n\n![Basic transitions within an organic molecule between the ground state $S_0$ and the excited singlet $S_1$, $S_2$,... $S_n$ and triplet states $T_1$, $T_2$,... $T_n$, represented in a Jablonski diagram](images/absorb.pdf){#fig-absorb}\n\nExcitons, after they absorb a photon, transition to the singlet state.\nSinglet states can undergo fluorescent decay (emission of light) or\nundergo intersystem crossing (ISC) into the triplet state. In typical\nfluorescent devices, the lifetime of fluorescent decay is much shorter\nthan ISC. ISC becomes enhanced in phosphorescent materials because of\ntheir strong spin-orbit coupling. The triplet state $T_1$ has long\nlifetimes of $\\mu s$-$ms$, which have subsequent pathways that include\nphosphorescent decay or reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). These\npathways are shown in @fig-absorb. Triplet deactivation are dominated by nonradiative\ndecay at room temperature, hence why triplets are usually called\nnon-emissive states. Phosphorescent decay can be increased by using\nheavy metal atoms with strong spin-orbit coupling.\n\nOpposed to a radiative decay (fluorescence) with a decay rate $k_r$, a\nmolecule can decay nonradiatively to the groundstate by internal\nconversion (IC). It has a decay rate $k_{nr}=\\tau_{nr}^{-1}$. To avoid\nnonradiative decay (NRD), a rigid and planar molecular structure can be\nintroduced to not have the vibrational coupling of $S_1$ and $S_0$\nstates, i.e. the $S_1$ will not vibrationally transfer its energy to\n$S_0$. Small band gap (long-wavelengths) molecules will suffer from\nvibrational coupling -- the effect is labeled the energy gap law.\n\n## Electrical properties of organic semiconductors\n\nThis section will be more detailed than the optical @sec-opti because this\nreport mainly focuses on electrically pumped laser diodes and OLEDs.\nFirst the basics will be discussed, followed by charge carriers and\ntheir process from injection to transportation.\n\n#### Charge carriers\n\nElectrons and holes within an organic semiconductor interact stronger\nwith the fixed atoms than in inorganic materials [@RN81]. This stronger\ninteraction causes a new consideration for holes and electrons -- a\nquasiparticle called a polaron [@RN4]. The lower polaronic state is\noccupied by a single charge, while the upper polaronic state is occupied\nwith two charges. The LUMO level fills the lower polaronic state with\npositive polarons (holes) and the HOMO level fills the higher polaronic\nstate with negative polarons (electrons). The polaronic stated cause\nadditional absorption bands, resulting in a new type of loss: polaron\ninduced absorption.\n\n#### Charge Transport\n\nCharge carriers in conjugated polymers are localized to a portion of the\npolymer chain, usually called the active unit or chromophore, because of\nthe lack of long-range translational symmetry [@RN43; @RN81]. Thus the\nonly way for charges to transfer between neighbouring molecules is via\nphonon assisted tunnelling, or a stochastic hopping process. The\nmobility of this hopping in organic semiconductors is between\n$10^{-8} cm/Vs$ to $10^{-3} cm^2/Vs$. Because hopping is highly\ninefficient, it explains the very low carrier mobilities in organic\nsemiconductors, contrasted to their inorganic counterparts [@RN4]. The\ncharge transport of an organic material is given by its electric\nconductivity $\\sigma$ that depends on the density of the charge carriers\n$n$, and the charger carrier mobility $\\mu$, given by\n$$\\sigma = \\mu n q$$where $q$ is the elementary electron charge [@RN4].\nWe can see from this relation that in order to achieve high electrical\nconductivity, and thus a high charge transport, the charge carrier\nmobility must be high. Further information on charge transport in\norganic semiconductors can be found in Refs. [@RN43; @RN44; @RN45].\n\n#### Electron-hole recombination\n\nSimilar to optical properties, because the exciton is stable at room\ntempetature, it is best to consider the the charge carrier pair in the\nexciton picture. In organic semiconductors, recombining electrons and\nholes generate excitons. Light emission is thus the radiative decay of\nthese excitons. The recombination is governed by Langevin theory\n[@RN83], such that we get the exciton formation formula\n$$e + h \\rightarrow\n\\begin{cases}\n    1/4,& S_n^*\\rightarrow S_1\\\\\n    3/4,& T_n^*\\rightarrow T_1\n\\end{cases}$$ where $S_n$ and $T_n$ are the higher-lying singlet and\ntriplet states respectively [@RN81]. Their lifetime is about 1 ps\nbecause of their ultra fast relaxation to the lowest excited state $S_1$\nor $T_1$. Spin statistics [@RN9] govern the 3:1 generation ratio of\ntriplets to singlet excitons, which has been experimentally determined\n[@RN84]. It is also important to note that these probabilities occur\nonly when the singlet--triplet gap is much less than $k_BT$. Most\npractical molecules are within this bound at room temperature; however,\nif the singlet--triplet gap is much larger than $k_BT$, triplets form\nwith nearly $100\\%$ probability [@RN65]. In other words, excitons decay\nto the ground state via the lowest triplet state if the singlet--triplet\nenergy gap is larger than $k_BT$.\n\nThe recombination of holes and electrons have a rate that is given by\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{e(\\mu_e+\\mu_h)n_e(x,t)n_h(x,t)}{\\epsilon_r\\epsilon_0}$$\nwhere recombination $\\gamma$ is a function of the charge carrier\nmobilities $\\mu_e$ and $\\mu_h$, and the electron density $n_e(x,t)$ and\nhole density $n_h(x,t)$. From this, high exciton generation needs high\nmobility materials as well as higher particle densities. Hole mobility\nis typically one order of magnitude larger than the electron mobility --\nsuch a difference means the recombination $\\gamma$ mainly depends on the\nhigher mobility.\n\n#### Charge carrier injection\n\nTo pass a current (charges) through an organic semiconductor it has to\nbe sandwiched between an anode and cathode. The entire structure is\ncalled an organic semiconductor light emitting diode (OLED). Once a\nvoltage is applied across the electrodes, the electrons and holes\ndiffuse through the layers. While OLEDs usually have a current density\nof a few $mA/cm^2$, laser diodes require much higher current densities.\nThe electrons are injected into the LUMO and the holes into the HOMO to\nform an exciton. OLEDs will be discussed further in @sec-OLED.\n\n### Energy Transfer\n\nExcitons play a pivotal role into how the organic molecule emits light\nbut their dynamics are not as simple as stationary particles. They can\nhave their energy transferred across several nanometers, which enables\nmovement between identical molecules and between a host/guest system.\nThese energy transfers can enable unique energy pathways to increase the\ntotal light emission. The two main transfers in organic semiconductors\nwill be discussed next.\n\n#### Förster resonance energy transfer\n\nFörster (sometimes called fluorescent) resonance energy transfer (FRET)\nis a resonant energy transfer process between two singlet exciton states\nof two molecules. It is a resonant process because the excited donor\nmolecule ($D^*$) decays without emission of a photon, and then transfers\nthe energy to an accepting molecule (A) (see @fig-FRET). FRET is\ngoverend by Fermi's golden rule for transfer between states, which means\nthey have a transfer rate $\\Gamma_{DA}$ from a donor (D) to acceptor (A)\nis $$\\Gamma_{DA} = 4\\pi^2|V_{DA}|^2]\\delta(E_A-E_M)$$ where $V_{DA}$ is\nthe matrix element for interaction of the donor and acceptor, who have\nenergies $E_D$ and $E_A$ respectively [@RN81]. The $\\delta$-function\ndescribes the need for the energies to match, or at least have spectral\noverlap of the absorption and emission spectrum. Even though the energy\ntransfer occurs without the emission of a photon, we tend to say that\ntypically the spectrum of the donor $g_A(E)$ overlaps with the\n*absorption* spectrum of the acceptor $g_D(E)$. The long-range\ndipole-dopole interactions between D and A cause the pairing of spectrum\noverlap. This coupling influences the rate of energy transfer, as well\nas the quantum yield of the donor, the relative orientation of D and A\ntransition dipoles, and the distance between the molecules. Integrating\nover the spectral overlap and evaluating the interaction matrix elements\nprovides the Förster formula which provides the total transfer rate\n$k_{DA}$\n$$k_{DA} = 8.8\\times10^{17} \\frac{\\kappa^2}{n^4\\tau_Dr^6}\\int g_A(E)g_D(E)dE$$\nwhich then can be written as\n$$k_{DA}(r) = \\frac{1}{\\tau_D}\\left(\\frac{R_0}{r}\\right)^6$$ where\n$\\tau_D$ is the decay time of the donor in the absence of the acceptor,\n$\\kappa$ is the relative orientation of the dipoles, $R_0$ is the\nFörster distance (typically a few nanometers [@RN79]), and $r$ is the\nD-to-A distance. Clearly, FRET is an extremely distance dependent\nprocess ($k_{FRET}\\propto r^{-6}$). FRET usually occurs at distances of\n20 to 90 Å, typical distances of proteins or membrane thickness [@RN79].\nThe transitions must be allowed, so that is why this process only works\nfor singlet excitons.\n\nFRET is mainly seen in a host/guest system, where in order to get\nsinglets from the host to guest, we utilise FRET to transfer singlets on\nthe host to the guest. FRET governs some of the bimolecular annihilation\nprocesses that are important in organic semiconductors. The key takeaway\nfrom this information is that this process is distance dependent, with a\n$50\\%$ efficiency at $r=R_0$ calculated from the efficiency $\\rho$ of\nthe energy transfer [@RN4]\n$$\\rho = \\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{r}{R_0}\\right)^6}$$\n\n![Förster resonance energy transfer is a dipole-dipole interaction, where in the absence of a photon, the Donor D releases energy that is reabsorbed by the acceptor A. The must be overlap between emission spectrum and absorption spectrum for the transfer to happen. Dexter energy transfer has simultaneous exchange of electrons and holes, such that an exciton is transferred between D and A. Singlets are displayed here, but Dexter energy transfer does work for triplets too.](images/FRET.pdf){#fig-FRET}\n\n#### Dexter energy transfer\n\nDET is one of the mechanisms of short-range quenching, and like the name\nsuggest the molecules need to be close. So close in fact that the D\nmolecule and quencher Q must have their electronic clouds overlap. DET\ndescribes an exchange of electrons from the LUMO of the donor to the\nLUMO of the acceptor. Similarly the hole is transferred the other way in\nthe HOMO. Such that the net transfer in a host/guest system is an\nexciton moving between the D and A [@RN85]. The difference between DET\nand Fret can be found in in @fig-FRET. The rate of DET $k_{DET}$ is\n$$k_{DET} = \\hbar P^2Je^\\frac{-2r}{L}$$ \nwhere r is distance between D and A, $J$ is the spectral overlap, and the other variables, P and L, are\nconstants that are hard to quantify [@RN85]. DET occurs only across\ndistances between $0.5$-$2$ nm, compared to the $2$-$10$ nm of FRET.\n\n## Losses in organic semiconductors\n\nThe current densities needed to achieve organic laser diodes are\nestimated to be at least $1 kA/cm^2$ [@RN9]. In organic semiconductors,\nto obtain this threshold means that the particle densities must be\naround $10^{19}/cm^3$ and electric fields of up to $10^7 V/cm$ are\nneeded -- this is considering the low mobilities of organic\nsemiconductors $10^{-8}-10^{-3}cm^2/Vs$ [@RN81]. Thus the populations of\nexcitons will need to be extremely high -- a perfect environment for\nincreased bimolecular annihilation processes. Here, a description of\nthese process will be described.\n\nBimolecular annihilation processes occur between particles within the\norganic semiconductor, such as charge carriers and excitons. Most of\nthese processes quench the emissive singlet excitons (see @fig-biomoc). Hence,\nthese processes are important to realising efficient light emission. The\ndiagram indicates the particle species by the circles, and which\npopulation they are quenching by the direction of the arrows. \n[Table 1.2](#tab:bimoc){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"tab:bimoc\"} shows the\nprocesses in terms of donor (D) and acceptor (A).\n\n![The bimolecular annihilation process are displayed in relation to singlets <span class=\"math inline\"><em>S</em><sub>1</sub></span>, triplets <span class=\"math inline\"><em>T</em><sub>1</sub></span>, and polarons e and h.

Table from [@RN4].\n:::\n\n#### Singlet-singlet annihilation (SSA)\n\nThe emissive excited state donor $D^*$ moloecule can be quenched by the\nidentical molecule, which when represented in the singlet-singlet\nprocess ($D^*=S_1$) is $$S_1 + S_1 \\rightarrow S_n + S_0$$ where $S_1$\nis the excited singlet state and $S_0$ is the ground state\n[@RN87; @RN88]. One molecule falls to the ground state, the other gets\nexcited to a higher singlet state $S_n$ that has a chance to decay\neither to the singlet state or the triplet state. The rate of SSA\n$k_{SSA}$ in terms of the $S_1$ population is given by\n$$\\frac{dS_1}{dt} = -(2-\\zeta)k_{SSA}S_1^2$$ where $\\zeta$ factor is\nbecause not all excited states $S_n$ are returned to the $S_1$ state.\nThe spin conservation is governed by spin statistics [@RN84], usually\n$\\zeta=0.25$ [@RN87]. $k_{ss}$ is usually on the order of\n$10^{-9} cm^3/s$. To measure this rate constant $k_{SSA}$ transient\nphotoluminescence measurements can be done [@RN89], which involves a\npulse measurement to a width less than the lifetime of radiative singlet\ndecay. Naturally, when the population of singlets are low, the rate of\nSSA becomes negligible.\n\n#### Exciton-polaron annihilation\n\nBoth singlet-polaron annihilation (SPA) and triplet-polaron annihilation\noccur under electrical injection because of the high lifetimes of\npolarons. The basic concept is the excitons transfer their energy by\ndeactivation to the polaron via the process\n$$S_1 / T_1 + (e,h) \\rightarrow S_0 + (e,h)$$ where the rate of\n$k_{SPA}$ can be different for hole or electron quenching. At low\ncurrent densities, SPA is negligible, but starts becoming a serious\nissue the more current injected.\n\n#### Singlet-Triplet Annihilation\n\nIf the $S_1$ and the $T_1$ state share overlap, the singlet and triplets\ncan interact causing an excitation to a higher triplet state $T_n$ and a\nnonradiative decay to the ground state. The process is\n$$S_1 + T_1 \\rightarrow S_0 + T_n$$ For non-TADF materials, where\nreverse intersystem crossing (RISC) is unlikely, the excited state $T_n$\nwill relax back to the long-lived $T_1$ and then subsequently\nnon-radiatively decay back the ground state. The rate equation for STA\nis $$\\frac{dS_1}{dt} = -k_{STA}S_1T_1$$ where $k_{STA}$ is usually on\nthe order of $10^{-9} cm^3/s$. This process is a FRET type transfer, and\nespecially dominate in conjugated polymers[@RN80] because the triplets\naccumulate in the device due to their long lifetimes.\n\n#### Intersystem Crossing (ISC)\n\nFor every excited singlet state, a triplet state lies lower in energy by\nan amount $\\Delta E_{ST}$ that is often referred to as the\nsinglet-triplet splitting. While not pertinent to understand why this is\nthe case, the extremely simplified explanation is that Pauli exclusion\nprinciple forces the spatial factor of the singlet wave function to be\nsymmetric and anti-symmetric for the triplet wave function. This\nsymmetry/antisymmetry causes the mean potential energy of the electrons\nto be higher for singlets than triplets with the same quantum numbers n\nand m. To read more in detail see Ref. [@RN75]. This relationships means\nwe get overlap with the wave functions that scales exponentially with\n$\\Delta E_{ST}$. Thus a nearly spontaneous transfer from the $S_1$\npopulation to the lower $T_1$ state becomes possible, which is called\nintersystem crossing (ISC). The pathway can be seen in @fig-ISC. The ISC rate\nequation $k_{ISC}$ can be formed: $$\\frac{dT_1}{dt} = k_{ISC}S_1$$\nFluourscent emitters have ISC rates on the order of hundreds of\nnanoseconds ($k_{ISC} ~ 10^7s^{-1}$ [@RN4], with a timescale of\n$\\tau_{ISC} = 1/k_{ISC}$. This rate depends strongly on the spin-orbit\ncoupling, as well as the vibrational overlap of the wavefunctions\n[@RN75].Reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) is the same process in\nreverse, but it is usually only seen in thermally activated delayed\nfluorescent materials where the $E_{ST}$ is small.\n\n![Intersystem crossing (ISC) displayed in a Jablonski diagram, along with Triplet Absoprtion (TA), and singlet-triplling splitting <span class=\"math inline\"><em>Δ</em><em>E</em><sub><em>S</em><em>T</em></sub></span> in a conjugated system.](images/ISC.pdf){#fig-ISC}\n\n#### Triplet-Triplet Annihilation (TTA)\n\nOrganic semiconductors under electrical excitation generate triplets at\na $75\\%$ chance to $25\\%$ singlets. This means that in these molecules\ntriplet-triplet annihilation plays a major role in the triplet dynamics,\nespecially because triplets are long-lived. The two triplet excitons\ninteract (annihilate) causing a transfer of energy from the first\nexciton to the second. The excited exciton goes to a higher lying state,\nwhich then relaxes so a singlet, triplet, or quintlet state. Although\nthis bimolecular process can be considered a loss, it can also lead to\ngain via the generation of singlets out of triplets. Hence the focal\npoint of this thesis is \\\"Can TTA be utilised to manage the triplet\nstates to increase the efficiency of emission such that organic laser\ndiodes can be realised?\\\". Triplet-triplet annihilation will be\ndiscussed in further in Section\n[1.5.0.3](#sec:type){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:type\"}.\n\n#### Induced absorption\n\nPhotons incident upon the conjugated molecule can be quenched by\npolarons and triplets because of the additional absorption bands. The\ntriplets and polarons care excited to a higher lying state and then\nrelax back to the original position. These losses only substantially\naffect laser diodes, so it will not be discussed any further. For more\ninformation, see Ref. [@RN90] for triplet absorption (TA) and Ref.\n[@RN91] for polaron absorption (PA).\n\n## Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) {#sec-OLED}\n\nThis thesis has the goal of achieving organic laser diodes; but in order\nto get there, OLEDs are the more cost efficient and easier method of\nanalysing the emissive layer. This thesis first aims to determine the\ntriplet-triplet annihilation property of an emissive layer, followed up\nby analysing the success of doping a TTA-exhibiting host with a\nefficient lasing guest. To do this, fabrication of OLEDs will be able to\ntest the electrical characteristics and performances of these materials.\n\n#### Device structure\n\nTo pass a current through an organic semiconductor, it has to be\nsandwiched between an anode and cathode, where we call the entire\nstructure an OLED device. Once a voltage is applied across the\nelectrodes, the electrons and holes diffuse through the layers. The\nexciton forms on the host, but if a dopant is present within the\nemissive layer, the exciton transfers to the guest via either Förster\nresonance energy transfer or by Dexter energy transfer [@RN3; @RN4]. To\navoid non-radiative losses (via heat), as shown in @fig-homo the host IP\nis usually larger than the guest HOMO. This enables a minimal barrier\nfor the transferring electron to overcome. Similarly, the cathodes --\ntypically indium tin oxide (ITO) as the anode and aluminium doped with\ncalcium as the cathode -- operate better if their work function align\nwith the IP and EA of the organic layers. Matching the energy levels of\neach layer within an OLED is crucial to efficient device performance.\nDiscussion of the energy levels concerned with this report's devices can\nbe found in their relevant section.\\\n\n::: {#fig-elephants layout-ncol=2}\n\n![](images/Asset%203%20(1).pdf){#fig-wideA}\n\n![](/images/Asset%202%20(1).pdf){#fig-wideB}\n\n\nFigure (a) is an example of a simple OLED device with its energy\nlevel diagram (b). Holes are injected from the anode into the hole\ntransport layer (HTL) such that the holes then have an easier time\nentering the emissive layer. Similar to the anode, electrons enter from the cathode into the electron transport layer (ETL). Electrons and holes recombine in the light emitting layer (EML), forming an exciton that has four possible permutations: three triplet states each with a total spin of 1, and one singlet state with a total spin of zero. \n:::\n\n\nModern day OLED architectures consist of as many as five or more organic\nlayers (see @fig-wideA), where each layer helps improve the luminescence\nefficiency, reduce operational voltage, and improve operational\nstability [@RN3; @RN5; @RN49]. The purpose of these layers were to give\nfine control over the charge injection, charge transport, electron-hole\npair (exciton) diffusion, and photon emission. These improvements led to\nOLED devices reaching the threshold efficiencies, and some now consider\nthem better than inorganic LEDs.\n\n#### Performance characteristics\n\nIt is extremely useful to define the efficiency of emitted fluorescence\nphotons versus the number of inputted photons or polarons (depending on\nphotoluminescence or electroluminescence). Such a ratio, called the\nphoto/electroluminescence quantum yield $\\phi_F(0<\\phi_F<1)$, enables\nmeaningful discussion about the efficiency of the device and where the\nlosses come from. It is defined as\n$$\\phi_F = \\frac{k_r}{k_r+k_{nr}+k_{ISC}}=\\frac{\\tau_nr}{\\tau_{rad}+\\tau_{nr}+\\tau_{ISC}}=\\frac{\\tau_F}{\\tau_{rad}}$$\nwhere $\\tau_F$ is the fluorescence lifetime [@RN4], a measure of the\nsinglet state's effective lifetime. The total decay rate $k$ is the sum\nof the radiative decay $k_r$ and nonradiative decay $k_{nr}$. The total\ndecay rate follows an exponential function, which can be fitted to the\ntime resolved luminescence to estimate the value via\n$$I(t) = I_0e^{-kt}$$ where $I_0$ and I(t) is the initial and time\nresponse luminescence intensities, respectively. The total efficiency of\na device is more than just the fluorescence quantum yield. This external\nquantum efficiency (EQE) is the total performance efficiency of the\ndevice that is given by\n$$\\phi_{EQE} = \\gamma \\phi_{spin}\\phi_F\\eta_{out}$$ where $\\gamma$ is a\nfactor describing how often charges recombine in the emissive layer\n(usually $\\gamma \\approx 1$), $\\phi_{spin}$ is the singlet-triplet spin\nprobability factor (in fluorescence $\\phi_{spin} ~ 0.25$), and\n$\\eta_{out}$ is a factor describing the percentage of light escaping the\ndevice (usually $\\phi_{out} ~ 20-25\\%$). $\\gamma$ and $\\eta_{out}$ are\naltered via the device architecture, while $\\phi_F$ and $\\phi_{spin}$\nare altered via the emissive layer. To put it into context for this\nreport, one focus is to choose the right emissive layer to obtain high\n$\\phi_F$ and $\\phi_{spin}$ and by proxy a high EQE. In this thesis,\n$\\phi_{spin}$ will be increased by utilising TTA, the process that\ngenerates extra singlet excitons from the triplets. $\\phi_F$ is low for\nTTA materials, so hence why it will be doped with a more efficient\nlasing material.\n\nOLEDs also need to consider operational lifetime, a key attribute that\nis directly proportional to the degradation of the devices due to losses\nsuch as localized heating, material decomposition, and Coulombic\ndegradation [@RN50; @RN51; @RN52; @RN53; @RN54; @RN55]. If the luminance\nefficiency is increased and thus reduces the current needed to achieve a\ntarget brightness, the operational lifetime is increased. This is why it\nis so important to try and reduce the current input, especially for\nelectrically pumped lasers. A typical OLED display operates at around\n$0.01 A cm^{-2}$; a typical inorganic semiconductor laser diode operates\nat a current density of $1000 A cm^{-2}$ [@RN1]. Hence decreasing the\ncurrent-density threshold by making the device more efficient is\nnecessary to achieving lasing. This is part of the motivation for this\nthesis.\n\n#### Types of emissive layers {#sec-type}\n\nAny light emitted from electrical injected we label as\nelectroluminescence (photoluminescence for optically pumped). To compare\nall the different ways emissive layers electroluminesce, the layers are\nlabelled depending on their emission pathway. Light emission via singlet\nexciton decay is labelled as fluorescence. Because fluorescent materials\ncan only emit photons from the singlet excited state [@RN3; @RN4; @RN9],\ntheir internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is limited to $25\\%$. We do not\nsee emission from the triplet excites states because the nonradiative\ndecay out-competes radiative decay at room temperature [@RN9]. At low\ntemperatures, triplet-state emission is possible, but is impractical. Up\nuntil 1997, most light emitting devices used fluorescent materials.\n\nOrganic phosphorescent dopants were discovered to be able to emit\nphotons from the decay of triplet excited states due to strong\nspin-orbit coupling, which led to high IQEs. They also have fast rates\nof singlet-triplet intersystem crossing (ISC). This meant that these\nphosphorescent materials could be used as a guest to extract the\ntriplets and singlet excited states via Dexter energy transfer from the\nhost. IQEs of up to $100\\%$ were achievable [@RN47; @RN48].\nPhosphorescent materials struggle at achieving operational stability\ncompared to fluorescent materials, especially in the blue emission\nregime [@RN67].\n\nThermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters offer an\nalternative way to harness the triplets than phosphorescent materials.\nIn TADF materials, the splitting $\\Delta E_{ST}$ between the singlet and\ntriplet excited-states enables the triplet exciton to transfer to the\nsinglet state via an efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC)\nprocess. The process needs thermal energy to transfer between energy\nstates; so typical TADF materials have a splitting of less than $0.5 eV$\nsuch that the thermal energy from room temperature suffices. Thus in a\nTADF emitter, the initial singlet excitons decay radiatively with a\nprompt emission (nanosecond timescale), which is then followed by a\ndelayed emission from the triplet-to-singlet RISC decay (microsecond to\nmillisecond timescale).\n\n@fig-emitters compares the emission mechanism in\nfluorescent, phosphorescent, and TADF emitters in a Jablonski diagram.\nUnderstanding these dynamics of exciton population and emission pathways\nis crucial to obtaining an efficient device. In terms of organic lasing,\nthe long decay lifetimes of triplet states are the biggest disadvantage\nfor phosphorescence, along with its scarcity and expensiveness of its\nmaterials. The TADF pathway has slow reverse intersystem crossing, which\nmeans that any realisation of lasing through this pathway will be\nunstable because of the slow singlet formation. On the other hand,\nfluorescent emitters have short excited-state lifetimes as well as\ncomparatively higher radiative rates. The issue of course with\nfluorescent emitters is their IQE of $25\\%$.\n\n![The decay mechanisms for singlet and triplet excitons within fluorescent, phosphorescent, and TADF emitters in a Jablonksi diagram.

Similar to TADF materials,\nthis pathway has a prompt component and a delayed component. The prompt\nemission comes from the direct singlet exciton, while the delayed\nemission comes after two triplets annihilate together (via\ntriplet-triplet annihilation, TTA) and produce a singlet that then\nradiatively decays. Triplet-triplet upconversion-based OLEDs have\nrealised external quantum efficiencies of $10\\%$ as opposed to the\ntheoretical limit of fluorescence-based OLEDs of $5\\%$.\n\n![The life of an exciton from formation (charge recombination) to decay via different pathways. Triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) with rate constant <span class=\"math inline\"><em>γ</em><sub><em>T</em><em>T</em><em>A</em></sub></span> involves one triplet non-radiatively decaying to the ground state, and the other being promoted to an intermediate state. The intermediate state then generates 1/4 singlets and 3/4 triplets, with the  Triplets being able to be recycled.](images/TTUTTA.pdf){#fig-TTUTTA}\n\n\nTriplet-triplet annihilation has two colliding triplet states leading to\nan intermediate state with twice the energy of the $T_1$ state. The\nintermediate states can then lead to one singlet state, three triplet\nstates, and five quintet states [@RN107]. This quintet state can be\nformed due to conservation of total spin angular momentum, but typically\nhas much higher energy than the two triplet states at room temperature\n[@RN106; @RN83; @RN27]; so the pathways for the intermediate state are\nthe higher-lying triplet $T_n$ state or to a singlet state $S_1$ (see\nAppendix [\\[apen:A\\]](#apen:A){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"apen:A\"}). Writing it mathematically, the pathways are\n[@RN107; @RN27; @RN83] $$\\label{eq:1} \n    T_1 + T_1 \\rightarrow T_n + S_0 \\rightarrow T_1+S_0$$ or\n$$\\label{eq:2}\n    T_1 + T_1 \\rightarrow S_1 + S_0$$ The generated triplets from the\ntriplet pathway can be recycled back into further TTA. So assuming no\nother decay channels for triplets, the maximum fraction of singlets\n$f_{singlets}$ from this series of TTA is\n$$f_{singlets} = \\frac{f}{2} \\sum_{n=0}^{n=\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1-f}{2} \\right)^n = f\\frac{1-f}{1+f}$$\nwhere $f$ is the fraction of $S_1$ singlets being formed from one TTA\nevent [@RN107]. If $f=25\\%$, $f_{singlets}=15\\%$. In some new anthracene\nderivatives, two triplet states have less energy than the higher lying\n$T_n$ state. This means the triplet pathway is unreachable and only the\nsinglet pathway can be accessed. In this scenario, $f=50$, so the\nmaximum singlet generation can be\n$S_{25\\%}+(T_{75\\%}\\times TTA_{50\\%} = 62.5\\%$. This leads to a maximum\nEQE of $12.5\\%$, but this pathway is restricted to a few materials\n[@RN108].\n\nThe rate constant of TTA $\\gamma_{TTA}$ can be paired with $f$ to create\nthe rate constants of each pathway $f\\gamma_{TTA}$ and\n$(1-f)\\gamma{TTA}$. To develop full singlet and triplet density\ndynamics, singlet-triplet annihilation (STA) needs to be included in our\nmodel [@RN27]. STA has the pathway [@RN83] $$\\label{eq:3} \n    T + S \\rightarrow T + S_0$$ with the rate constant $k_{ST}$. The\nfull dynamics are therefore\n$$\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\gamma(J) \\frac{J}{4ed} - (k_s+k_{s.nr}+k_{ISC}S - k_{ST}ST + f\\gamma_{TTA}T^2$$\nand\n$$\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\gamma(J) \\frac{3J}{4ed} - k_{T,nr}T - k_{ISC}S - (1-f)\\gamma_{TTA}T^2$$\nwhere TTU has a rate $\\gamma_{TTU}=f\\gamma_{TTA}T^2$ (process\n([\\[eq:1\\]](#eq:1){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"eq:1\"})), process\n([\\[eq:2\\]](#eq:2){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"eq:2\"}) has a rate of\n$(1-f)\\gamma_{TTA}T^2$, process ([\\[eq:3\\]](#eq:3){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"eq:3\"}) has a rate $k_{ST}ST$, $\\gamma(J)$ is the charge\nbalance factor [@RN109; @RN110], $e$ is the electron charge, $d$ is the\nemissive layer thickness, and $k_s$ and $k_T$ are the singlet and\ntriplet natural decay rates. These dynamic equations can be solved in\ntwo limiting stead-state conditions [@RN107; @RN111; @RN112]. TTA is\ndistance-dependent between the neighbouring triplets in solid films,\nsuch that at low current density when minimal triplet exciton population\nthe mini-triplet decay dominates over the bimolecular triplet\nannihilation ($k{T,nr}T\\gg \\gamma_{TTU}T^2$). Setting\n$\\gamma(J)\\frac{J}{4edk_{T,nr}} \\equiv T_{G}$, the triplet population is\n$T = \\frac{T_G}{k_{T,nr}}$ such that the singlet population from TTU in\na neat film is $$S = \\frac{\\gamma_{TTU}}{k_{T,nr}+k_S}T^2$$ such that\nthe luminance L is proportional to current density by $$L \\propto J^2$$\nIn steady state, the EQE can be calculated via\n$EQE(J) = \\eta_{out}\\phi_{F} \\frac{k_sS(J)}{J/(ed)}$, such that at low\ncurrent density the EQE is proportional to current density by\n$$EQE \\propto J$$\n\nAt increasing current density, the triplet excitons become abundant and\nthe bimolecular process dominates the dynamics\n($k{T,nr}T\\ll \\gamma_{TTU}T^2$). In this regime, the $L\\propto J$ and\nthe EQE becomes insensitive to current, meaning the usual EQE roll-off\nwould occur. The quadratic dependence on J at low current densities\ntransitions to the a linear dependence above the critical triplet\ndensity $T{transition}\\>(k_{TTU}\\tau)^-1$ [@RN113] (see @fig-loglogTTU)\n\n![The two regimes of triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion at low and high current densities.

To record measurements\nfor an OLED, we can apply a voltage in direct current (DC) operation or\nalternating current (AC) via a pulse. The main measurement variables are\nvoltage (V), current density ($mA/cm^2$), and luminance/brightness\n($cd/m^2$), with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) needing to be\ncalculated from these measurements.\n\n#### DC measurements\n\nIn DC measurements, typically measurements of the main three variables\nare done over a range of voltages to construct a current\ndensity-voltage-luminance, or J-V-L, graph. In training, I created an\nOLED with Super Yellow, poly(phenylenevinylene), as the emissive layer.\nIts J-V-L graph shows the natural increase in current density as voltage\nis increased -- luminance follows suit too. For the external quantum\nefficiency, there usually is a peak EQE for a certain current density.\nThis is after current density is able to produce sufficient excitons but\nbefore losses start settling in. In this case, STA and polaron quenching\ndominate and cause the typical EQE roll off.\n\n![Performance characteristics for two common poly(phenylenevinylene) (Super Yellow) devices [ITO (100nm)/PEDOT (30nm)/Super Yellow (70nm)/Calcium (5nm)/Aluminium (60nm)] that was made as part of training. a) Typical current density-luminance-voltage (J-V-L) graph. b) EQE as a function of current density.](images/JVLSY.pdf){#fig-perfo}\n\n#### Pulse Measurements\n\nAt high current densities, OLEDs experience degradation due to Joule\nheating, an effect that causes dark spots on the emitting pixel area of\nthe OLED. Under DC measurement, Joule heating is amplified. So it\nbecomes essential to not only use short voltage pulse to one avoid Joule\nheating, but also to observe transient electroluminescence. This is\nuseful because triplet excitons, because they are long-lived, can be\nreduced under pulse regime. This leads to reduction in induced\nabsoprtion losses. In other words, a pulse measurement can achieve a\nhigh singlet population before the triplet excitons approach a\nsteady-stage. The rates of bimolecular process, as well as decay rates,\ncan be analysed and calculated via the transient pulse\nelectroluminescence. No calculations are done in this thesis, but\ninclusion of this sets the foundation for the next step.\n\n### Organic semiconductor lasers\n\nDespite this thesis not containing any fabrication of lasers, it is\nstill important to discuss what a laser is and how organic\nsemiconductors can achieve lasing. Lasing was first achieved using ruby\ncrystals [@RN92], with organic molecules following close after with\noptically pumped lasers [@RN93; @RN94]. It was not until 1996 that the\nfirst organic semiconductor solid-state laser was developed [@RN8],\nwhich was the first step towards reaching organic semiconductor lasers\n(OSL) that are able to display the entire visible spectrum. OSLs are\neven at the stage of demonstrating lasing while on flexible substrates\n[@RN95] and low-threshold operation [@RN96], but no stable electrically\npumped lasers. In this section, optically pumped lasers will be\nelucidated.\n\n#### Optical gain\n\nAn external light source pumps an amplification (gain) medium, where\npopulation inversion occurs between two states. Two-level mediums are\nnot practical for lasing, so the four-level system is employed to obtain\nlow-threshold operation. Such a four-level system has an optical\nexcitation from the ground state $\\ket{1}$ to a the excited state\n$\\ket{2}$ (see @fig-laserpath). The excited state relaxes to a lower\nexcited state $\\ket{2}$ that decays radiatively via the laser transition\n(3). This means the $\\ket{3}$ state has to the most populated state and\nthe $\\ket{2}$ state be virtually unpopulated because of its fast\nlifetime. Population inversion is when state $\\ket{3}$ has a higher\npopulation than state $\\ket{4}$. When this inversion happens, stimulated\nemission can be achieved, where an incoming photon resonates with the\nexcited state and causes a radiative decay with the same wavelength,\npolarization, phase, and direction as the incoming photon. This process\nis \\\"stimulated\\\" because it needs an incident photon and it results in\ncoherent light.\n\nIn organic semiconductors, this process happens between the excitonic\nground state $S_0$ and the excited singlet state $S_1$, along with their\nhigher vibrational levels. Hence, organic semiconductors are inherently\nfour-level systems.\n\n![Left: A Jablonski diagram that shows the pathways of a four-level system. Radiative transfers of energy are the (1) and (3) pathway; (2) and (4) are relaxation process. Right: the intrinsic four-level system of an organic semiconductor is due to the additional vibronic energy levels at the ground state and excited state.](images/laserpath.pdf){#fig-laserpath}\n\n\n## Laser Structures\n\nThere are a few different resonator types that enable lasing, such as\nplanar micro-cavities, Fabry-Perot cavities, micro-ring, microdisk, and\nmicrospherical resonators. Though distributed feedback (DFB) resonators\ncan tune the wavelength by altering the period the light travels in the\noptical gain material. This is done by changing the film thickness to\nalter the effective refractive index. A simple OSL structure is shown in\nFigure [1.12](#images/laseramp){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"images/laseramp\"}.\n\nA simple organic semiconductor laser needs to have lower losses than the\ntotal gain/amplification to achieve lasing. This total gain is dependent\non the stimulated emission cross-section $\\sigma_{em}$. The losses\ndepend on reabsorption or other exciton quenching pathways, as well as\ncavity losses. The lasing condition is the electric field $E_0$ of the\nconfined light being able to replicate the same path\n$$E_0 = E_0 exp(i4\\pi nL/\\lambda_0)\\sqrt{R_1R_2e^{2L(g-\\alpha)}}$$ where\n$R_1$ and $R_2$ are the reflectivities of the mirrors $L$ distance\napart, $\\lambda_0$ is the vacuum wavelength, $g$ and $\\alpha$ are the\nmodal gain and loss respectively [@RN97]. There must be intervals of\nacceptable length L because of the imaginary component. This condition\ncan be written $$L = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{2n}m$$ where m is an integer. As\nmentioned previously, the modal gain $g$ must be higher than the\ncombines losses, written mathematically [@RN97]\n$$g \\geq \\alpha - \\frac{ln(R_1R_2)}{2L}$$ To understand gain better, a\nlook at the population dynamics of the levels. Spontaneous emission from\n$S_1$ to $S_0$ $N_{10}$ is governed by\n$$\\partial N_{10} = N_1A_{10}\\partial t$$ but is changed when undergoing\nstimulated emission: $$\\partial N_{10} = N_1u(\\lambda)B_{10}\\partial t$$\nwhere $N_1$ is the poulation of the $S_1$ state, $u(\\lambda)$ is the\nphoton density, and $A$ and $B$ are the Einstein coefficients. Because\nstimulated emission is now dependent on the Einstein coefficient $B$,\nthe gain of the material is now too. And because\n$B \\propto \\sigma_{em}$, we have\n$$\\sigma_{em} = \\frac{\\lambda^4E_f(\\lambda)}{8\\pi n^2c\\tau_f}$$ where\n$n$ is the average refractive index of the gain medium, $c$ is the speed\nof light, $\\tau_f$ is the fluorescence lifetime of the emissive lyaer,\nand $E_f(\\lambda)$ is the spectral distribution of its PLQY. From this\nformula, we can see to optimise the stimulated-emission cross section,\nand hence the gain, a low $\\tau_f$ (fast decay) and high PLQY with\nnarrow spectra is needed.\n\n![A mirror, gain medium, semi-transparent mirror, and an external pump source all comprise the basics of a laser.](images/laseramp.pdf){#fig-laseramp}\n\n\n#### Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)\n\nWithout needing to build a cavity, the prospect for lasing can be\nevaluated by use of a simple waveguided structure that enables a weak\nbut intrinsic optical feedback. ASE still sees spectral narrowing of the\nfull-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM), but does not exhibit coherent\nemission out. This is because, while population inversion has occurred,\nspontaneous emission dominates the system instead of stimulation\nemission.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","pdf-engine":"pdflatex","output-file":"intro.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","bibliography":["references.bib"],"comments":{"hypothesis":true},"toc-location":"right","toc-title":"On this page:","code-copy":true,"theme":"lux","jupyter":"python3"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"pdflatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"intro.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"comments":{"hypothesis":true},"documentclass":"scrreprt","jupyter":"python3"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
