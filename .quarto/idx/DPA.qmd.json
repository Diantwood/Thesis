The OLED structure can be found in Appendix\n[\\[apen:oledex\\]](#apen:oledex){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"apen:oledex\"}. 2,6-DPA was based in OLEDs in neat and doped\nemissive layers, which their performance was analysed under steady state\nand nanosecond pulse excitation. The high $wt\\%$ of mCBP host doped into\nthe layer is used to separate the chromophores of 2,6-DPA. Herein, I\nfound that 2,6-DPA exhibits the TTU mechanism to generate extra singlet\nexcitons, while the host-guest system fails to exhibit TTU, as expected.\nAt low-current densities (J) the EQE of the device increases\nproportionally to $J$ because of the absence of dominating\nsinglet-triplet annihilation (STA). At high current densities, STA\nbecomes a significant loss causing a reduction in EQE and gain.\n\n::: {layout=\"[[40,60], [1]]\"layout-valign=\"bottom\"}\n\n![Chemical structure of 2,6-DPA](images/DPA.jpg){#fig-dpa}\n\n![chemical structure of mCBP](images/mCBP.png){#fig-mcbp}\n\n![Normalised electroluminescence (EL) spectra for 2,6-DPA neat film and host-guest 2,6-DPA/mCBP (10wt%)](images/DPAMCBPSPEC.pdf){#fig-dpasepc}\n\n![The energy-level diagram of OLEDs based on 2,6-DPA](images/dpaenergy.pdf){#fig-dpaenergy}\n\n![The energy-level diagram of OLEDs based on 2,6-DPA/mCBP](images/mcbpenergy.pdf){#fig-mcbpenergy}\n\n:::\n\n## Results\n\nThe OLED devices that were creates followed the structure, Indium Tin\nOxide (ITO) 100nm /\nN,N'-Di(1-naphthyl)-N,N'-diphenyl-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diamine (NPB)\n40nm / 2,6-DPA 40nm / 1,3,5-Tris(3-pyridyl-3-phenyl)benzene (TmPyPB)\n30nm / Calcium 5nm / Aluminum 100nm (see @fig-dpaenergy). Each layer was\nthermally evaporated under high vacuum ($10^-6 mbar)$ without break to\navoid atmosphere exposure. To achieve $10wt\\%$ , a simultaneous doping\nof mCBP and 2,6-DPA with deposition rates $0.1Å/s$ and $1Å/s$\nwas required. The deposition rate for the organic layers were between\n$0.3 - 0.6Å/s$. Within the device (see @fig-dpaenergy), there is a\nsubstantial hole injection barrier, enabling an accumulation of holes at\nthe DPA/TmPyPB interface. The thickness and structure was chosen as per\nthe OLEDs made in Ref. [@39], where they found 40nm DPA layers performed\nbest. The NPB layer has excellent energy level alignment to facilitate\nhole-injection and transport [@RN146]. Calcium is similar to Lithium\nFluoride (LiF) in terms of energy level, so it was used instead a the\nbuffer layer. Hole-blocking and electron transport layer were decided as\nTmPyPB because of the deep HOMO and matching LUMO energy levels. Such a\nstep-wise energy level diagram enables efficient injection and transport\nof charge carriers. The spectra showed a strong blue emission (peak 445\nnm), matching the characteristic anthracene blue.

Four neat film devices were fabricated each\nhaving eight pixels (four $0.75mm^2$ and four $0.3mm^2$). Due to faulty\ncontacts, thermal evaporation alignment issues, and scratches or\nblemishes on the substrate window some pixels become unable to be\ntested. Others can degrade whilst a voltage is applied. The J-V-L graph\nof four different pixels, as well as their EQE graph, can be found in\nAppendix [\\[apen:dpaextr\\]](#apen:dpaextr){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"apen:dpaextr\"}. A turn-on voltage of $3.1\\pm0.1$ V was\nachieved at the defined $1 cd/m^2$, with the maximum brightness\napproaching $4500\\pm500 cd/m^2$ at $9\\pm0.2$ V.

The\npeak EQE of these 2,6-DPA devices, however, do not exceed the\ntheoretical maximum EQE of $2.1\\%$ (calculated using the PLQY of\n$41.2\\%$ [@RN39]).\n\nThe doped 2,6-DPA in 10wt% of mCBP devices were thermally evaporated,\nfollowing the structure: Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) 100nm /\n1,1-Bis\\[(di-4-tolylamino)phenyl\\]cyclohexane (TAPC) 35nm / 2,6-DPA/mCBP\n(10wt%) 40nm /\n2,2',2\"-(1,3,5-Benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBi)\n65nm / Calcium 5nm / Aluminum 100nm (see @fig-mcbpenergy).

The\nnon-doped OLED demonstrates a clear regime change with a slope of\n$~1.7\\pm0.05$ at low current densities, changing into $~0.74\\pm0.03$.\nThe transition current density is roughly $~20\\pm10 mA/cm^2$. The slope\nis $<2$ due to imperfect TTU and losses, such as STA and other\nquenching. An observed slope shift from $>1$ to $<1$ indicates definite\ngain of triplet to singlet excitons.\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Log-log scale Luminance versus current density graph for OLEDs based on non-doped 2,6-DPA emissive layers](images/DpAAfit.pdf){#fig-dpafit}\n\n![Log-Log scale J-V-L for doped 2,6-DPA emissive layers](images/mCBPfit.pdf){#fig-mcbpfit}\n\n:::\n\nPulse measurements (transient electroluminescence) will demonstrate the\npopulation dynamics of the excitons even to high current densities. For\nthe non-doped film, 300 ns pulse widths were used to suppress Joule\nheating while maintaining long enough steady-state lifetime to see the\ngradual EL increase from TTU. The device area used was $0.7mm^2$ to\nreduce geometrical capacitance that minimises RC response distortion.\nFor doped films, a long pulse width ($1.5\\mu s$) was used to extrapolate\nthe affect STA had on fluorescent materials at high current densities.\nWhilst DC measurements only reached current densities of $1 A/cm^2$,\npulse measurements reach densities of $>2.5 A/cm^2$. At high current\ndensities, doped and non-doped devices show a sharp rise, characteristic\nof space charge limited current conditions), with the initial rise\nlifetime of $~30 ns$. Non-doped devices at a lower current density sees\na longer initial rise ($100ns$ at $10 V$) followed by a gradual increase\nas time progresses. This is characteristic of TTU devices because of the\nrecycling nature of the triplet excitons generating additional singlets.\nAt high current densities (40 V) the steady state shows a slight\ndecrease, indicating STA has dominated rate over the TTU generation\nrate. How STA affects the steady state in non-TTU devices can be seen in\ndoped-devices (see @fig-mcbppulse}) -- a noticeable decrease in EL as time progresses.\nThere is a $~12\\%$ difference between the steady states at higher and\nlower current densities. At lower current densities, STA is not\nprevalent so a steady state is visible. STA dominates via FRET, a\nprocess that is determined by the spectral overlap between $S_1$\nemission aand $T_1\\rightarrow T_n$ absorption bands.\n\n::: {#fig-pulse layout-ncol=2}\n\n![](images/DPApulse.pdf){#fig-dpapulse}\n\n![](images/DPApulsezoom.pdf){#fig-dpapzoom}\n\n![](images/mCBPpulse.pdf){#fig-mcbppulse}\n\n![](images/mCBPpulsezoom.pdf){#fig-mcbppzoom}\n\n\nTransient EL spectra of non-doped (a) for a 300 ns pulse width and doped (c) for 1.5<span class=\"math inline\"><em>μ</em><em>s</em></span> across many voltages.

In neat film OLEDs, 2,6-DPA shows\ndistinctive TTU properties such as distinctive regimes in the J-L\nlog-log plot, with a TTU threshold of $~20\\pm10 mA/cm^2$. Not only does\nit exhibit steady state increase at low current densities, showing a\n$40\\%$ rise over $~300ns$ pulse width, but it also exhibits a delayed\nfluorescence component following the triplet-triplet upconversion DF\ntrend. The TTU process in neat films can be seen in @fig-ttadpa.\nThis 2,6-DPA neat film was compared to the doped film 2,6-DPA in\n$10wt\\%$ mCBP, which was created to separate the chromophores of 2,6-DPA\nto extend the triplet states beyond the short-range Dexter energy\ntransfer process. This was successful as the doped OLED showed trends of\ntypical fluorescence. Despite the peak EQE not surpassing the\ntheoretical maximum of typical fluorescent emitters -- a feat that would\nconfirm extra exciton generation -- the evidence presented here is\nenough to show 2,6-DPA shows promise for enhancing a host-guest system\nwith TTU. To increase device performance, optimisation of fabrication\nprocess and device structure needs to be considered specific to an\namorphous 2,6-DPA film.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","pdf-engine":"pdflatex","output-file":"DPA.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","bibliography":["references.bib"],"toc-location":"right","toc-title":"On this page:","code-copy":true,"theme":"lux"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"pdflatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"DPA.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
