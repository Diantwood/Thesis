Each of these individuals have tolerated my shenanigans\nthroughout the year. Without their patience and expertise, I would not be where I am\ntoday. Similarly, thank you to the COPE team for listening to me ramble and struggle my\nway through this thesis.\n\n\nI want to next thank my family who have always got my back. To my mother, even\nthough I may waterboard you with nonsense physics, the calls and conversations you have\nendured do not go underappreciated. To my father, your work ethic has inspired me to\nalways keep pushing, even when this thesis seemed unobtainable ”Dad would have kept\ngoing, so will I”, I would think. To the brothers of mine, the Civil Trio, I now have this huge\ndocument, I guess – I don’t recommend it. I love you all.\n\n\nTo my family away from home, Tamar Street. You’ve kept me humble by reminding me\nto ”leave the thinking to the intellectuals”; you’ve reminded me to relax and have fun in a\nyear of doubt and stress; you’ve pushed me to do the things I love and be more of myself\nthan ever. Sam with basketball, Spencer with gym, Will with yarns, Doug with F1, Laura\nwith movies, Mia with intellectual-discussions, Sarah with yard-bevvies, Nicola with gossip,\nCass with mental-support: all of you are fantastic.\n\n\nTo myself, well done, bud. You got there. Not the way we imagined at the start, but we\nfinished. Remember why you did this, but don’t forget what you learned while doing this.\n\n\nTrust The Process."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","pdf-engine":"pdflatex","toc":false,"output-file":"acknowledge.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","bibliography":["references.bib"],"toc-location":"right","toc-title":"On this page:","code-copy":true,"theme":"lux"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"pdflatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","toc":false,"output-file":"acknowledge.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
