{"title":"Conclusion","markdown":{"headingText":"Conclusion","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nDespite advertising this paper is on the path to electrically pumped\nlasers, this thesis had its reticle focused on achieving triplet-triplet\nannihilation upconversion in 2,6-DPA to dope it into typical fluorescent\nlasing material, Coumarin6, to surpass its theoretical external quantum\nefficiency maximum. While this thesis was not able to achieve an\nincreased performance on either device -- neat film 2,6-DPA or doped\n2,6-DPA/Coumarin6 (1wt%) -- the devices showed promise in exhibiting TTU\nproperties. It was confirmed in four different ways: displaying EQE roll\nup at low current densities; demonstrating two distinct regimes in a J-L\nlog-log plot separated by a critical triplet density; transient steady\nstate electroluminescence progressively increasing over time at low\ncurrent densities; and transient electroluminescence delayed\nfluorescence displaying the characteristic TTU curve. While these were\nconfirmed, to truly feel confident about TTU in these devices, the peak\nEQE must surpass the theoretical maximum. This will be the next step.\n\nThe conclusions made from this work demonstrates the need to continue\ndown this path toward electrically pumped organic lasers. The future\nwork possible thanks to this thesis will be explained here.\n\n## Outlook\n\n### Optimization\n\nThe device in this thesis struggled to perform with high EQE. Particular\nattention to optimisation of thermal evaporation needs to be considered,\nto make the host-guest system of 2,6-DPA and Coumarin at $1-2wt\\%$\ncomfortably achievable. Different device thickness could further\noptimise injection and recombination of polarons. Further experiments to\noptimize the results also need to be completed. Transient\nelectroluminescence of variant pulse widths to analyse the dynamics -- a\nprocess that is a step towards simulating rate equations.\n\n### Simulate rate equations\n\nRate equations of STA and TTA need to be calculated from the singlet and\ntriplet population rate equations, such that the transient EL can be\nanalysed and understood. For example, this thesis only qualitatively\nanalyses the dominant STA and TTA process at low or high current\ndensity. Simulation would provide rates that could be used to calculate\nthe necessary threshold current density for lasing. TTA becomes\nimportant at high current density because of it is proportional to the\ntriplet population, $n_T^2$, and STA is proportional to $n_{T1}n_{S1}$.\nSuch a way to reduce STA, while keeping TTU high, is to minimize the\nspectral overlap between the singlet and triplet absorption spectrum.\n\n### ASE measurements\n\nThe first step in really testing lasing is via amplified spontaneous\nemission (ASE). If the device experiences light amplification using a\nTTU assisted emitter, it shows promise that lasing can be achieved. This\nis because the ASE threshold can be converted into a singlet exciton\ndensity threshold that can be used to calculated the current density\nthreshold. This can only be done with the rate equations of SSA, STA,\nand TTA. However ASE measurements should be attacked only once higher\nEQEs are reached.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","pdf-engine":"pdflatex","output-file":"conclusion.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","bibliography":["references.bib"],"toc-location":"right","toc-title":"On this page:","code-copy":true,"theme":"lux"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"pdflatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"conclusion.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
