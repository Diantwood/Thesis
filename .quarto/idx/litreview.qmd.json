The papers claiming to have achieved lasing will be\nintroduced and evaluated in @sec-laser. To tie\nthis review into the experiments in this thesis, the current\ntriplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion literature will be\nreviewed and evaluated. Collectively, this literature review will\ncompare alternative materials as options to achieve lasing and argue for\nthe present investigation: achieving electrically pumped lasing via TTA\nupconversion.\n\n## Prospects of Electrically Pumping {#sec-laser}\n\nAlthough countless papers have published results confirming realisation\nof lasing emission from electrical excitation, only a few have been\nconvincing, even fewer have achieved lasing, and none have achieved\nstable emission. One paper claimed lasing in tetracene single crystals\n[@RN56], but was subsequently retracted as part of the Schön scandal.\nAnother paper [@RN57] reported a 410 nm emission from $Alq_3$ blended\nwith Nile Blue, but neither of those materials emit at the reported\nwavelength. It is believed to be an emission from the indium that has an\natomic line at 410 nm [@RN1]. Also curiously, is the alleged lasing\nvoltage of 0.27 V with a threshold current of 0.088 mA in a millimeter\ndimension device.\n\n### Progress\n\nLaser emission from a pulsed DCJTI dye doped material was reported\n[@RN60] sandwiched between dielectric mirrors. They report, at a current\ndensity of $860\\ mA \\ cm^{-2}$, narrowing of the emission linewidth (2.6\nnm to 2.0 nm), change in beam divergence (53 mrad to 13 mrad), and claim\nthe threshold for optical pumping is the same for electrical pumping.\nHowever, a paper by Samuel *et al.* [@RN61] reviews the article and\ncalls it \\\"puzzling\\\". The narrowing is far too small compared to the\n10-50 factor reduction seen in microcavity OSLs. The threshold is five\norders of magnitude smaller than equivalent structures. Duarte *et al.*\nhas strong words against this paper too [@RN3].\n\nSimilarly, a paper by Lin *et al.* [@RN59] reports a threshold of\n$~2\\ mA \\ cm^{-2}$, which is considerably lower than any predicted\nthreshold from many publications. Baldo *et al.* [@RN20] suggests a\nthreshold of greater than $5\\ A \\ cm^{-2}$, while Kozlov *et al.*\n[@RN62] calculated, for a Fabry-Perot laser with a DCM-doped $Alq_3$\nemissive layer at 5ns pulsed excitation, a threshold current density of\n$200\\ A\\ cm^{-2}$. $200\\ A\\ cm^{-2}$ would be too high for continuous\noperation but works in the pulse regime [@RN1]. A distributed feedback\nstructure works better than a Fabry-Perot resonator, where it can reduce\nthe threshold to an estimated $80\\ A cm^{-2}$ [@RN63].\n\nSpatially coherent light was reported in a tandem OLED structure under a\npulse domain using Coumarin 545 T [@RN58]. The structure was too weak to\nachieve laser behaviour ($800 mA\\ cm^{-2}$), yet shows good prospects.\nAnother paper, Cai *et al.* [@RN64], reported lasing action; however\nsimilarly to previous attempts has a low threshold ($0.8 mA  cm^{-2}$\nand line width of 0.5 nm.\n\nA recurring theme is the failure to recognise lasing. Samuel *et al.*\npoints out four key properties of light amplification by stimulated\nemission or radiation in a resonator. The first is narrow linewidth\nemission. Second is the light output comprises a beam. Third is there\nwill be a clear threshold (change in slope) of output power and\nlinewidth. Finally, the fourth is the emission will resemble the output\nexpected of the specific gain medium and resonator.\n\n### Success at last\n\nIn 2019 Sandanayaka *et al.* [@RN15] reported blue lasing from an\nelectrical excitation of a conventional OLED that incorporated a\nmix-order distributed feedback $SiO_2$ grating. OLEDs, with high\nefficiency and EL emission efficiency, tend to only notably increase EQE\nup to current densities of $1\\ A \\ cm^{-2}$. However, these current\ndensities are not close to the injection of $1 \\ kA \\ cm^{-2}$ that is\nneeded for lasing [@RN9]. This was their reason to use a single-layer\nstructure containing no heterointerface, such that excitons generated\nand deactivated in the emitting layer. The mobility of the lasing\nmaterial used, BSB-Cz, for both electrons and holes was\n$10^{-4}cm^2/Vs$. Sandanayaka *et al.* celebrated a constant EQE up to\n$~1\\ kA \\ cm^{-2}$ without drastic roll-off. As well as the polaron\nabsorption overlap of 600 to 1000 nm, which avoids overlap of the\nemission spectrum of the blue (460 nm) BSB-Cz. The lasing threshold was\nabout $700\\ A\\ cm^{-2}$ with a spectral width of 0.2 nm. The issue with\nthis laser is that it displayed very short device lifetime.\n\n### Issues\n\nElectrically pumped lasers suffer from a whole slew of complex problems\n[@RN98; @RN20; @RN69]. Forget and Chénais [@RN9] ignore the losses and\nassume a lower limit for calculating the current density threshold:\n$$J_{threshold} = \\frac{n_s^{threshold}e}{\\phi_{spin} \\phi_F\\tau_{rad}}$$\nwhere $n_{threshold}$ is the surface density of singlet excitons, e is\nthe elementary charge, $\\phi_{spin}$ is the exciton recombination rate\nto generate singlets (fluorescence has $\\phi_{spin}=0.25$), $\\phi_F$ is\nthe PLQY, and $\\tau_{rad}$ is the lifetime of radiative decay. They\nassume values of $\\tau_{rad}~1ns$, and $\\phi_F~1$ to obtain the\nthreshold $$J_{threshold} ~ 1 kA/cm^2$$ For triplet-triplet annihilation\nupconversion, some materials have an upper $\\phi_{spin}$ limit of\n$0.65$. This brings the new threshold for TTU to\n$$J_{TTA} ~ 0.5 kA/cm^2$$ Unfortunately this is only a lower limit.\nLosses will inevitably seep their way in, increasing the practical\nlimit. This thesis focuses on decreasing the emissive layer losses, but\na brief overview of structural losses will be included as well. The\nfirst issue is the problematic electrical contacts that cause problems\nwith optical confinement. The metallic electrodes absorb the guided\nmode, an absorption that is enhanced by the similar refractive indices\nof organic molecules. This loss further reduces the light out. Some\nmethods have been used to reduce the overlap between the optical mode\nand the electrode [@RN99; @RN100; @RN101; @RN102]. There are bountiful\npolarons present at high current densities. Unfortunately they have a\nbroad absorption band, meaning they overlap with the emission spectra\nand can quench the emission [@RN20]. Both electrical contact issues and\npolaron absorption can be resolved with higher mobility. Organic\nlight-emitting field-effect transistors (OLEFETs) show potential to fix\nthese problems simultaneously [@RN103], but OLEFETs are outside the\nscope of this thesis.\n\nThe loss that this thesis focus on is the triplet exciton issue -- by\nfar the most difficult to overcome. Not only does electrical pumping\ndirectly generate triplets, but triplets have much longer lifetimes\n(~$ms$ [@RN104]), causing pile-up in long-pulse or high repetition-rate\nregime [@RN4]. Even under the more favourable short pulse regime\n[@RN105], triplets still cause issues such as absorbing laser photons\n(triplet absorption), or quench singlets (singlet-triplet annihilation)\n[@RN69]. Giebink *et al.* [@RN69] showed that STA was the dominant\nmechanism, and TA. Lehnhaardt *et al.* [@RN72] showed STA and TA induce\nlosses in guest/host systems.\n\n### Design rules for organic laser diodes\n\nTo summarise the losses, this section aims to elaborate on the design\nrules that must be kept in mind when trying to realise OSLs.\n\n#### Balanced carrier mobilities\n\nAt high excitation, high charge carrier mobility is vital to reduce the\nlosses, such as bimolecular annihilations, induced absorption losses,and\nfield-induced exciton dissociation [@RN81]. One simulation predicted\ncarrier mobilities of at least $5\\times10^{-2}cm^2/Vs$ to achieve a\nlasing input of $10kA/cm^2$ [@RN81]. Furthermore, the mobilities of both\nelectrons and holes need to be balanced. If not, exciton recombination\nwill not happen in the emissive layer because the lower mobility charge\nwill only be injected a few nanometers into the emissive layer [@RN81].\nHence, thicker emissive layers will reduce bimolecular annihilation\nprocesses.\n\n#### Guest-Host\n\nGust-host systems enable low self-absorption because of the separate\nemission/absorption energies. Host-guest systems will also reduce\nfield-induced exciton dissociation, while maintaining a high singlet\nexciton density [@RN81].\n\n#### Pulse operation\n\nJoule heating degrades the emissive layer, a process that DC operation\namplifies. Pulse measurements not only will reduce this heating, but it\nalso enables triplets to decay before triplet absorption dominates.\n\n### Triplet Dynamics\n\nIf we are to ever realise electrically pumped lasers, triplets and their\nusually not luminescent property, must be managed. Harvesting emission\nfrom triplets via phosphorescence [@RN22] was a promising turning point\nfor OLEDs because it increased the internal quantum efficiency (IQE)\nfrom $25\\%$ to an achievable $100\\%$. Triplet dynamics have been\nunderstood to be a great obstacle in organic lasing\n[@RN74; @RN72; @RN73], especially electrically pumped\n[@RN20; @RN67; @RN68]. Some ways around managing triplets are by adding\n\\\" triplet scavengers\\\" [@RN71] or \\\"triplet managers\\\" [@RN73], or a\nway that managed to remove triplets with \\\"plasmonic sinks\\\" [@RN70].\n\nThe triplet state $T_1$ is the lowest energy of some $T_n$ number of\ntriplet states. Triplets $T_1$ usually decay to the ground state but can\nundergo a photon absorption and be excited to a higher energy triplet\nstate via a process called triplet absorption (TA). $80\\%$ of the time\nthis excited state relaxes back to the $T_1$ rapidly (300 fs timescale),\nbut the remaining percent dissociate into charges [@RN78]. We can start\nseeing that the the long-lived triplet population from instant\ngeneration of triplets and ISC triplets dominate the exciton population\nin electrically injected systems. Hence, managing these usually\nnon-emissive triplets is essential. This is where we utilise the fact\nthat a chromophore in a solid-state material always has neighbours.\nTTU-based OLEDs show IQEs of up to $62.5\\%$ [@RN27; @RN28], which is not\nthe $100\\%$ phosphorescent or TADF molecules.\n\n#### Why not phosphorescence? {#sub:phos}\n\nPhosphorescence on a casual glance might seem very enticing for\nelectrically pumped lasers due to the triplet problem. You might ask\nyourself: If phosphorescence is able to emit light via the triplet state\n$T_1$ and the singlet state $S_0$, then under electrical excitation we\ncan utilise the favoured triplets to obtain an $100\\%$ internal quantum\nefficiency (IQE)? Well we can first consider each colour. Red emitters\nwould have to compete with nonradiative decay because of the energy-gap\nlaw. Blue emitters suffer from being unstable due to the higher energy\nof the singlet state lying in the UV range. To now cut green from the\nequation, the additional losses must be considered.\n\nFor a laser, triplet absorption must be avoided. From the Köhler and\nBässler rule of thumb [@RN75], the stimulated emission\n$T_1 \\rightarrow S_1$ directly competes with $T_1 \\rightarrow T_n$\nabsorption. Typically, the overlap of these spectral bands is very high\nfor these two process, which causes phosphorescence to struggle in\nachieving electrically pumped lasing [@RN4]. A material would need to\nnot only exhibit strong spin-orbit coupling to enable phosphorescence,\nbut also to have the emission spectrum shifted from the triplet\nabsorption spectrum [@RN4]. Jenekhe *et al.* [@RN77] attempted a\nIr(ppy)3 phosphorescent emitter and Schols [@RN76] attempted a\nBtp2Ir(acac) phosphorescent emitter to observe Amplified Spontaneous\nEmission (ASE). Both were met with nothing promising.\n\n### Is triplet-triplet upconversion the way forward?\n\nTTA molecules display efficient blue emission, minimal EQE roll off,\nlower operation voltage, and low processing cost\n[@RN114; @RN115; @RN116; @RN117; @RN118; @RN119]. Typical OLEDs express\na EQE roll off due to losses such as STA, SPA, and loss of charge\ncarrier balance [@RN120], yet in a TTU-based OLED, TTA upconversion\ncounteracts these processes. Molecules that exhibit efficient TTA\nupconversion must have these requirements\n\n1.  Singlet energy level lower than two triplet states\n    ($S_n \\leq 2 \\times T_1$)\n\n2.  Long triplet lifetime\n\n3.  TTA that cannot access the second triplet excited-state $T_2$\n\nThe molecules that meet these requirements come under the polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbon acenes, such as antrhracene, tetracene, rubrene,\nand their derivatives [@RN21; @RN121; @RN122; @RN123; @RN124; @RN125].\nAn efficient aluminium complex ($Almq_3$) doped with coumarin6 OLED had\nan EQE of $7.1\\%$ [@RN126] -- the first device to surpass the\nfluorescent limit by using TTU.\n\n#### TTU as host\n\nMolecules that exhibit TTU generally suffer from low PLQY because of\naggregation induced quenching or excimer formation [@RN21]. Thus these\nmaterials can be used in OLEDs as a host to produce efficient devices\nthat emit at the guest's wavelength [@RN106; @RN127; @RN128; @RN129].\nThe excitons are formed directly on the host and then the singlets (both\ndirect and TTU singlets) are transferred via FRET to the guest for\nemission. It is necessary that the overlap of anthracene units between\nneighbouring molecules are reduced [@RN130].\n\n#### TTU as guest\n\nNot only can TTU be used a host, but it can be used as a guest to\nimprove the EQE of a non-doped device. Many devices with high EQEs\n(\\>10%) have been fabricated with TTU as a guest\n[@RN128; @RN131; @RN133; @RN134]. There have also been devices with TTU\nas both the host and guest [@RN135; @RN136].\n\n#### Neat film TTU\n\nIn an attempt to simplify the device structure and fabrication process,\nwhile avoiding parasitic energy loss [@RN21], non-doped TTU devices have\nalso been fabricated [@RN137; @RN138]. They have seen high EQEs, some of\nthe highest in non-doped devices ($10\\%$) [@RN139].\n\n#### TTU in Lasers\n\nTriplet-Triplet annihilation upconversion has not seen extensive\ndevelopment when it comes to organic lasers [@RN145]. The ultrafast\nlifetime of upconversion provides more excitement for the realisation of\nlasers than TADF molecules that display slow RISC lifetimes. So it is\nlikely the limited $62.5_max$ IQE present in TTU devices that has\nshunned away researchers. This thesis aims to demonstrate the promise of\nusing TTU as a mechanism to manage the triplet excitons for the purpose\nof electrically pumped lasers.\n\n#### TTU in this thesis\n\nThis thesis considers first neat film molecule with the aim in showing\nthat it has triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion. To analyse the requirement that TTU needs close\nrange DET transfers to efficiently perform, the TTU material is doped in\na large weight percentage as a guest in a host. This separates the TTU\nchromophores, resulting in limited DET transfer and subsequently\nlowering the TTU rate. Hence it will show the molecule's dependence on\nnearby neighbouring chromophores. Then the TTU molecule will be doped as the host into\na lasing material to improve the PLQY of the device and show TTU\nenhanced devices can be possible. Even though doping affects the charge\nmobilities of the system [@RN140], the increased PLQY should see\npositive results.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","pdf-engine":"pdflatex","output-file":"litreview.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","bibliography":["references.bib"],"comments":{"hypothesis":true},"toc-location":"right","toc-title":"On this page:","code-copy":true,"theme":"lux"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"pdflatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"litreview.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"comments":{"hypothesis":true},"documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
